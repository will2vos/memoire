  Our study was conduct within the Portneuf Wildlife Reserve in the Captial-Nationale administrative region (72°24'W, 47°07'N) near Rivière-à-Pierre and Lac Amanites. 
  This area is located within the balsam fir-yellow birch bioclimatic domain (Saucier et al., 2009) and lie on a deep glacial till as surface deposit (Gosselin, 1998).
  The mean daily temperature is 4 ◦C for the 1981-2010 period of the nearest weather station (Lac aux sables)(Environment Canada, 2019). 
  Based on the same report, the mean annual precipitation and snowfall are respectively 1133.2 mm and 230.3 cm.
  We used the assisted migration experimental system establish in 2018 by the Minister of Natural Resources and Forests to collect our data (MNRF)(Royo, 2023).
  This system is a factorial experimental design with a split-split-split-plots using 4 replications (complete random blocks). 
  Each whole block (200 m x 140 m) is occupied by an overstory treatment (clearcut and 50\% shelterwood cut). 
  A cervid exclusion treatments (excluded and non-excluded) is used as a split plot and a competing vegetation treatments as a split-split plot. 
  Climatic analogs associated with three climate projections (current climate, mid-century 2050, and end of century 2080) 
  are used as a split-split-split plots with the seedlings of 9 species in mixed planting: black cherry (\textit{Prunus serotina}), northern red oak (\textit{Quercus rubra}), 
  northern white-cedar (\textit{Thuja occidentalis}), shagbark hickory, (\textit{Carya ovata}), sugar maple (\textit{Acer saccharum}), red pine (\textit{Pinus resinosa}), 
  red spruce (\textit{Picea rubens}), white spruce (\textit{Picea glauca}), and white pine (\textit{Pinus strobus}).

\subsection*{Sampling design}
\label{subsec:sampling}
\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\nameref{subsec:sampling}}

We selected six sampling units (10 m x 7,5 m each) in both overstory treatment in four blocks and added three controls units outside every blocks for a total of 60 units in our system. 
Controls were separated from the blocks per at least 10 meters to remove treatments effects.
Each sampling unit contained three methods to collect species data. 
Artificial cover boards were used to count red-backed salamanders (Hesed, 2012; Mazerolle et al., 2021; Moore, 2009), 
pitfall traps for the carabid monitoring (sources), and soil cores with litter collection for springtails assessment (sources) (figure).
We conducted four sampling periods of five consecutive days each, namely in mid-May, mid-June, mid-July, and mid-August, during the summer 2022, to assesse the temporal effect. 
Blocks were randomly visited to reduce time of day and sampler's fatigue level effects.

Artificial coverboards is commonly employed for salamander sampling and yield similar or superior results compared to other methods such as active searching (Hyde, Simons, 2001; Moore, 2009). 
This method helps reduce variability in the number and size of sampled ground objects (Hyde and Simons 2001). 
Coverboards were made of spruce wood, measured 25 cm x 30 cm x 5 cm and were placed directly on the ground without litter underneath to maintain higher humidity level under the boards (Mazerolle et al., 2021). 
Six boards were set per sample and control units, resulting in a total of 360 coverboards.
They were positioned in two rows of three boards each, centered and oriented along the length of the sampling units.
Boards were spaced 2.5 m apart along the length of the sampling unit and 5 m apart along the width.
All boards were put outside during march 2022 to provide aging of the boards under natural conditions, thereby increasing their likelihood of being used by salamanders (article).
Throughout the sampling periods, cover boards were inspected once on the same day, and salamanders were counted without any manipulation.

Pitfall trapping is a passive sampling method used to assess the species richness of ground-dwelling invertebrates (Knapp, Růžička, 2012; Kotze et al., 2011; Lövei,  Sunderland, 1996). 
This capture method works particularly well for active arthropods moving on the ground, such as carabids (Baars, 1979; Lövei, Sunderland, 1996). 
Pitfall traps were produced by Bio.Contrôle services and included a container with a diameter of 12.5 cm, a depth of 25 cm and a cover raised 4.5 cm above the trap 
to prevent debris and rain from filling the container (figure ?).
They were equipped with a protective grid with a mesh size of 15 mm, limiting trap access to carabid-sized individuals and reducing the chances of predation by small mammals. 
Typically, a preserving liquid (such as propylene glycol or alcohol) is placed in the bottom of the container to preserve captured individuals. 
However, salamanders can have a width comparable to that of certain carabids, and therefore get captured and drown in the traps. 
For ethical reasons and considering the difficulties to limit access to salamanders without influencing the sampling of carabids, 
we decided to use dry pitfall traps without any preserving liquid (Luff, 1975). 
We also add wet sponges to the bottom of each container to maintain a suitable level of humidity for salamanders.
One pitfall trap was installed in the center of each unit and control units (figure), resulting in a total of 60 pitfall traps. 
Each trap was placed in the soil at a depth allowing the container's opening to be juxtaposed with the soil surface. 
Pitfall traps were opened the first day of each visits and individuals captured were collected for each remaining day.
individuals captured in the pitfall traps were collected daily and two soil samples were harvested per sample and control untis.
Outside the sampling periods, all pitfall traps were closed with adhesive tape around the opening to prevent individuals capture.

Soil cores is commonly used to sample mesofauna in litter and different soil horizons (Chauvat et al., 2011; Farská et al., 2014; Ponge, 2000; Salamon et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2014). 
Two soil cores with litter collection were harvested per sampling unit per visit using a soil sampling pedological probe. 
Cores were harvested randomly inside the coverboards area to associate the presence of springtails with salamanders and carabids detection (figure). 
Cores had a diameter of 5 cm, a depth of 5 cm and a 15 cm x 15 cm litter quadrat was collected above each soil sample (sources).
Both substrates were used to target mesofauna and obtain springtail communities directly related to the ecology of salamanders and carabids (Chauvat et al., 2011; Edwards, 1991; Raymond-Leonard et al., 2018, Rousseau ).
Soil and litter from the same unit were pooled in Ziploc\up{\uppercase{tm}} bagswrapped in aluminum foil and stored in a cooler at $\pm$ 4°C (Chauvat et al., 2011, Rousseau), providing 60 unit samples per period.
Samples were placed in a Tullgren dry-funnel within 48 hours after after the harvest for springtails extraction within 48h (Figure )(Rusek, 1998; Wu et al., 2014, Laigle). 
The extraction process lasted six days with a gradual temperature escalation, including two days at 30°C, followed by two days at 35°C, and two days at 40°C (Laigle).
Springtails were preserved in 75\% alcohol (Wu et al., 2014) prior to isolation from surrounding organisms, with subsequent identification at the family level.
