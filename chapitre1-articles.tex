  Our study was conduct within the Portneuf Wildlife Reserve in the Captial-Nationale administrative region (47°07'N, 72°24'W, Figure \ref{fig:cartoblock}) near Rivière-à-Pierre and Lac Amanites. 
  This area is located within the balsam fir (\textit{Abies balsamea})-yellow birch (\textit{Betula alleghaniensis}) bioclimatic domain \citep{saucierChapitreEcologieForestiere2009}.
  Tree cover also contain sugar maple (\textit{Acer saccharum}), red maple (\textit{Acer rubrum}), white spruce (\textit{Picea glauca}), black spruce (\textit{Picea mariana}), red spruce (\textit{Picea rubens}),
  white birch (\textit{Betula papyrifera}) and quaking aspen (\textit{Populus tremuloides}) (foret ouverte, rapport d'inventaire). 
  The site lie on a deep glacial till as surface deposit with a moderately well-drained sandy loams soil (Gosselin, 1998).
  The mean daily temperature is 4 ◦C for the 1981-2010 period of the nearest weather station (Lac aux sables)(Environment Canada, 2019). 
  Based on the same report, the mean annual precipitation and snowfall are respectively 1133.2 mm and 230.3 cm.
  We used the assisted migration experimental system establish in 2018 by the Minister of Natural Resources and Forests to collect our data (MNRF, \citealp{royoDesiredREgenerationAssisted2023}).
  This system is a factorial experimental design with a split-split-split-plots using 4 replications (complete random blocks). 
  Each whole block (200 m x 140 m) is occupied by an overstory treatment (clear-cut and partial-cut). 
  A cervid exclusion treatments (excluded and non-excluded) is used as a split plot and a competing vegetation treatments as a split-split plot. 
  Climatic analogs associated with three climate projections (current climate, mid-century 2050, and end of century 2080) 
  are used as a split-split-split plots with the seedlings of 9 species in mixed planting: black cherry (\textit{Prunus serotina}), northern red oak (\textit{Quercus rubra}), 
  northern white-cedar (\textit{Thuja occidentalis}), shagbark hickory, (\textit{Carya ovata}), sugar maple (\textit{Acer saccharum}), red pine (\textit{Pinus resinosa}), 
  red spruce (\textit{Picea rubens}), white spruce (\textit{Picea glauca}), and white pine (\textit{Pinus strobus}).

\subsection*{Sampling design}
\label{subsec:sampling}
\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\nameref{subsec:sampling}}

We selected 60 sampling units (10 m $\times$ 7,5 m) to collect our data : six units per overstory treatment (clear-cut and partial-cut) with three control outside the blocks for four blocks.
Controls were separated from the blocks per at least 10 meters to remove treatments effects.
Each sampling unit contained three methods to collect species data. 
Artificial cover boards were used to count red-backed salamanders \citep{hesedUncoveringSalamanderEcology2012,mazerolleWoodlandSalamanderPopulation2021a,mooreComparisonPopulationEastern2009c}, 
pitfall traps for the carabid monitoring (sources), and soil cores with litter collection for springtails assessment (sources) (figure).
We conducted four sampling visits of five consecutive days each, namely in mid-May, mid-June, mid-July, and mid-August, during the summer 2022, to assesse the temporal effect. 
Blocks were randomly visited to reduce time of day and sampler's fatigue level effects.

Artificial coverboards is commonly employed for salamander sampling and yield similar or superior results compared to other methods such as active searching \citep{hydeSamplingPlethodontidSalamanders2001,mooreComparisonPopulationEastern2009c}. 
This method helps reduce variability in the number and size of sampled ground objects \citep{hydeSamplingPlethodontidSalamanders2001}. 
Coverboards were made of spruce wood, measured 25 cm x 30 cm x 5 cm and were placed directly on the ground without litter underneath to maintain higher humidity level under the boards \citep{mazerolleWoodlandSalamanderPopulation2021a}. 
Six boards were set per sample and control units, resulting in a total of 360 coverboards.
They were positioned in two rows of three boards each, centered and oriented along the length of the sampling units.
Boards were spaced 2.5 m apart along the length of the sampling unit and 5 m apart along the width.
All boards were put outside during march 2022 to provide aging of the boards under natural conditions, thereby increasing their likelihood of being used by salamanders (article).
Throughout the sampling visits, cover boards were inspected once on the same day, and salamanders were counted without any manipulation.

Pitfall trapping is a passive sampling method used to assess the species richness of ground-dwelling invertebrates \citep{knappEffectPitfallTrap2012,kotzeFortyYearsCarabid2011a,loveiEcologyBehaviorGround1996}.
This capture method works particularly well for active arthropods moving on the ground, such as carabids \citep{baarsCatchesPitfallTraps1979,loveiEcologyBehaviorGround1996}. 
Pitfall traps were produced by Bio.Contrôle services and included a container with a diameter of 12.5 cm, a depth of 25 cm and a cover raised 4.5 cm above the trap 
to prevent debris and rain from filling the container (figure ?).
They were equipped with a protective grid with a mesh size of 15 mm, limiting trap access to carabid-sized individuals and reducing the chances of predation by small mammals. 
Typically, a preserving liquid (such as propylene glycol or alcohol) is placed in the bottom of the container to preserve captured individuals. 
However, salamanders can have a width comparable to that of certain carabids, and therefore get captured and drown in the traps. 
For ethical reasons and considering the difficulties to limit access to salamanders without influencing the sampling of carabids, we decided to use dry pitfall traps without any preserving liquid \citep{luffFeaturesInfluencingEfficiency1975}. 
We also add wet sponges to the bottom of each container to maintain a suitable level of humidity for salamanders.
We centered one pitfall in each sampling and control units (figure), resulting in a total of 60 pitfall traps. 
Traps were inserted in the soil at a depth allowing the container's opening to be juxtaposed with the soil surface. 
Outside the sampling visits, all pitfall traps were closed with adhesive tape around the opening to prevent individuals capture. 
On the first day of each visit, traps were opened and carabids captured were collected for each remaining day. 
Individuals were placed in a container with 20\% alcohol and identified at the species level afterwards.
Identification was conduct with a (modele du binoculaires) using André Larochelle identification keys (source)(annexe).
Carabids were categorized in two groups as salamander prey or competitors based on the salamander gape size (table)(source).

Soil cores is commonly used to sample mesofauna in litter and different soil horizons \citep{chauvatChangesSoilFaunal2011a,farskaManagementIntensityAffects2014,pongeVerticalDistributionCollembola2000,salamonEffectsPlantDiversity2004,wuCompositionSpatiotemporalVariation2014}. 
Two soil cores with litter collection were harvested per sampling unit per visit using a soil sampling pedological probe. 
Cores were harvested inside the coverboards area to associate the presence of springtails with salamanders and carabids detection (figure). 
Cores had a diameter of 5 cm, a depth of 5 cm and a 15 cm x 15 cm litter quadrat was collected above each soil sample (sources).
Both substrates were used to target mesofauna and obtain springtail communities directly related to the ecology of salamanders and carabids \citep{chauvatChangesSoilFaunal2011a,edwardsAssessmentPopulationsSoilinhabiting1991,raymond-leonardSpringtailCommunityStructure2018a,rousseauForestFloorMesofauna2018}.
Soil and litter from the same unit were pooled in Ziploc\up{\uppercase{tm}} bags and stored in a cooler at $\pm$ 4°C (Chauvat et al., 2011, Rousseau) \citep{chauvatChangesSoilFaunal2011a,rousseauForestFloorMesofauna2018}, providing 60 unit samples per visit.
Samples were placed in a Tullgren dry-funnel for springtails extraction within a maximum of 48 hours after the harvest (Figure, (Rusek, 1998) \citealp{rousseauForestFloorMesofauna2018,wuCompositionSpatiotemporalVariation2014}). 
The extraction process lasted six days with a gradual temperature escalation (25°C to 50°C) \citep{raymond-leonardSpringtailCommunityStructure2018a}.
Springtails were preserved in 75\% alcohol \citep{wuCompositionSpatiotemporalVariation2014} prior to isolation from surrounding organisms, with subsequent identification at the family level.
Identification was done with a (modèle du bino et du microscope) by using (nom de l'auteur de la clé d'identification) identification keys (source).
Springtails dry biomass per samples units was quantified with a Sartorius Cubis\up{\uppercase{tm}} MSA3.6P-000-DM micro balance after being lyophilized with a Labconco FreeZone Bulk tray dryers 78060 series.



\subsection*{Environmental variables}
\label{subsec:EnvVar}
\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\nameref{subsec:EnvVar}}

In each sample units, we measured several environmental variables that could affect occupancy, as it has an impact on habitat use by species.
Coarse woody debris (CWD) and litter depth play a crucial role in habitat use for salamanders, carabids and springtails as
they serve for protection, feeding and to maintain suitable temperature and humidity \citep{birdChangesSoilLitter2004,groverInfluenceCoverMoisture1998a,harmonEcologyCoarseWoody1986,koivula.LeafLitterSmallscale1999,mckennyEffectsStructuralComplexity2006,patrickEffectsExperimentalForestry2006a}. 
We used a 400 m\up2 plots centered inside every sampling units to estimate CWD per units (20 m $\times$  20 m)(Figure 7, \citealp{methotGuideInventaireEchantillonnage2014}). 
We only selected CWD with a basal diameter greater than or equal to nine centimeters and a length greater than or equal to one meter.
Subsequently, we measured basal diameters, apical diameters and CWD's length with a tree caliper. 
Segments of CWD outside the plots boundaries wasn't considered.
We employed (Fraver et al., 2007) conic–paraboloid formula to estimate the volume of each CWD :
\[Volume = L/12 \times (5A_b + 5A_u + 2\sqrt{A_b \times A_u})\]

Where $L$ is the length of logs, $A_b$ the basal area, and $A_u$ the apical area.
We measured litter depth next to each coverboards and estimated the mean depth per sampling units \citep{mazerolleWoodlandSalamanderPopulation2021a}. 
We assessed canopy openness, as it may influence species activity \citep{henneronForestPlantCommunity2017,koivulaBorealCarabidbeetleColeoptera2002a,kotzeFortyYearsCarabid2011a,messereForestFloorDistribution1998,tilghmanMetaanalysisEffectsCanopy2012}.
Measurements were conducted at the center of all sampling units using a spherical densiometer \citep{lemmonSphericalDensiometerEstimating1956} and were taken at 130 cm above the ground. 
We took four measurements per units, oriented toward each of the four cardinal points, and used the mean results to estimate the canopy openness per sampling units.

We used air temperature, air humidity and precipitation levels as detection variables.
These variables fluctuate on a daily basis, affecting species activity and, consequently, the probability of detecting individuals. 
\citep{butterfieldCarabidLifeCycle1996,kotzeFortyYearsCarabid2011a,loveiEcologyBehaviorGround1996,odonnellPredictingVariationMicrohabitat2014a,spotilaRoleTemperatureWater1972}.
Two compact weather stations (Em50 Digital Decagon Data Logger, Part \#40800, Meter Group Inc., USA), placed on the clear-cut area, were available during the summer 2022.
Those station were equipped with a rain gauge and a probe measuring temperature, air humidity, and atmospheric pressure (1.30 m above the ground)(VP-4 Sensor (Temp/RH/Barometer), Part \#40023)
The temperature and humidity sensors were programmed for readings every 15 minutes. 
We used daily average measurements from both station since informations form previous years showed no differences between blocks (Annexe).



\subsection*{Statistical analyses}
\label{subsec:analyses}
\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\nameref{subsec:analyses}} 

To assess the effects of overstory treatments on the site occupancy of taxa, we combined structural equation with occupancy models \citep{graceSpecificationStructuralEquation2010,josephIntegratingOccupancyModels2016,mackenzieOccupancyEstimationModeling2006a}.
Sructural equation models (SEM) are well adapt to study complex path relationships and allow to investigate on an ecological process \citep{graceStructuralEquationModeling2008}.
Based on a theoretical framework, all studied variables are interconnected in a network where the effect of a disturbance on each variable can be estimated by taking into account 
the disturbance effects on other related variables \citep{graceStructuralEquationModeling2008}.
It allow us to measure direct and indirect processes that influence species occurrence by considering interrelationships between treatments, taxa and environmental variables (Figure \ref*{fig:SEM}, \citealp{graceSpecificationStructuralEquation2010}).
Furthermore, occupancy models enable us to account for the imperfect detection of species since salamanders and carabids are known to be cryptic species and therefore may be present but unobserved \citep{baileyEstimatingSiteOccupancy2004,spiersEstimatingSpeciesMisclassification2022}
Occupancy modeling uses repeated surveys to compute detection probabilities and estimate the species true occupancy \citep{mackenzieEstimatingSiteOccupancy2002,mazerolleMakingGreatLeaps2007}.
Our model was designed to explain how overstory treatments can affect environmental variables (CWD, canopy openness, litter depth) 
and species occupancy (salamanders, carabids) or biomass (springtails), while accounting for imperfect and variable species detection (precipitation, CWD)(Figure \ref*{fig:SEM}).
Analysis was performed with a Bayesian approche and parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) with JAGS 4.3.0 include in the jagsUI package in R 4.3.1 \citep{lunnBUGSProjectEvolution2009,kellnerJagsUIWrapperRjags2024,rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2020}.
We applied non-informative priors to all parameters by using normal distribution N($\mu = 0$, $\sigma^2 = 100$) and uniform distribution U($0,1$) as $\beta$ estimates. 
We also included a block random effect to estimate all parameters and allow each overstory group to have there own variance due to heteroscedasticity. 
We executed the model with five chains, 200,000 iterations each \citep{gelmanUnderstandingPredictiveInformation2014}. A burn-in period of 75,000 iterations was used and a thinning rate of 5 was applied. See Table X for more details.
We verified the convergence of MCMC chains by examining trace plots, posterior density plots, and applying the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistic.
