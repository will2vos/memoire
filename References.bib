Feeding on both plant and animal material and scavenging are probably more significant than currently acknowledged. The most important mortality sources are abiotic factors and predators; pathogens and parasites can be important for some developmental stages. Although competition among larvae and adults does occur, the importance of competition as a community organization is not proven. Carabids are abundant in agricultural fields all over the world and may be important natural enemies of agricultural pests.},

	abstract = {Soil-inhabiting invertebrates are extremely diverse in form, differ greatly in size and numbers, and are often aggregated in horizontal and vertical distribution. Methods available for assessing populations are all based on representative samples. They include field counting, use of attractant traps or pitfall traps, and assessing numbers of invertebrates in soil samples. Invertebrates can be separated from soil either by wet or dry methods based on physical principles, or by dynamic methods which use stimuli to make them leave the samples. Physical methods of separation include hand sorting of soil, soil washing and flotation, elutriation in an upward flow of water, use of a technique which involves passing soil over plates covered with a grease film in which the invertebrates become embedded, and centrifuging soil samples in water or dense solutions so that invertebrates come to the surface. Dynamic methods suitable for most arthropods include the use of dry funnels with, high controlled temperature and moisture gradients, and wet-funnel methods which are used mainly for nematodes and echytraeid worms. Dry funnels which are easy to use are the most popular technique, but have the drawback that they do not extract eggs or resting stages. Wet funnels, which are more laborious, recover these stages, but also dead individuals. Flotation methods are best for sandy soils, whereas dry funnels are more efficient for peat or clay soils. For most soils, dry funnels are most efficient for the extraction of micro- and mesoarthropods, but flotation is usually preferable for macroarthropods.},

	abstract = {I evaluated how the abundances of two species of forest-dwelling plethodontid salamanders, Plethodon cinereus and P glutinosus, are related to moisture level and availability of cover by manipulating moisture levels and cover object density on experimental plots. I also investigated how cover and moisture influence the physical condition and activity level of the most common of the two species, P cinereus. The experiment was a 2 x 2 factorial design in which plots had either low or high densities of cover objects (rocks, logs, and coarse woody debris) and were either watered by sprinklers two to three times weekly or received no supplemental watering. Nocturnal searches of the plots revealed that watering increased the abundance of juvenile R cinereus, and increased the activity levels of both juveniles and adults. Increased densities of cover objects resulted in increased abundance of both adult and juvenile P cinereus. Plethodon glutinosus was more abundant on watered plots and on plots with high densities of cover objects than on unwatered plots and plots with low densities of cover objects. The P cinereus on plots with high densities of cover objects were of higher mass, adjusted for body length and tail length, than conspecifics on plots with low densities of cover objects. This suggests that the foraging success of terrestrial salamanders is dependent on cover object availability. The findings of this study indicate that moisture levels and cover object availability are both significant factors in regulating abundances of terrestrial salamanders, but that different species and different age-classes of the same species can vary in their responses to these factors.},

One such technique is irregular shelterwood logging, but its impacts on forest ﬂoor organisms are poorly known. Our objective was to quantify the effects of three different treatments of irregular shelterwood on population structure and the body condition of the eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) 5–6 years following harvesting. A total of 64 sites in western Québec were sampled using artiﬁcial refugia and quadrat searches. Large salamanders ({\textgreater}32 mm) were more abundant in the gap treatment than in strip, uniform, or control treatments. Small salamanders (≤32 mm) followed the same pattern, although the differences were marginal. For a given treatment, small salamanders were as abundant as large salamanders. Salamander body condition differed between the 2 years of sampling but did not differ among treatments, regardless of salamander size. We conclude that environmental conditions in irregular shelterwood treatments 5–6 years following harvesting support populations of small vertebrates on the forest ﬂoor.},

	abstract = {Artificial cover objects or coverboards have been widely used to study Eastern Red-backed Salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), a species that is very abundant in eastern North America and known to be one of the most common vertebrates within its geographical range. However, recent studies have suggested that potential bias may be associated with the use of coverboards compared with natural cover objects. In this study, age structure and body size (weight and snout-vent length, SVL) of P. cinereus found under coverboards and natural cover objects at Lake Clair (Quebec, Canada) were compared. Coverboards were made of Sugar Maple (Acer sacchrum), a native forest species dominant in the study area. In 2004 and 2005, a total of 162 P. cinereus were found under coverboards, and 156 P. cinereus were found under natural cover objects. No significant difference in the age structure, mean weight, or SVL of P. cinereus was observed between the two sets. This study suggests that the type of coverboard used at Lake Clair is a good method to obtain an accurate index of P. cinereus population demographics, and is similar to that expected under natural cover objects. This technique should help to establish a standard protocol that could better allow direct comparisons among studies in the future. However, more studies are needed to explain the high proportion of adult specimens found under both cover types at Lake Clair relative to studies in other regions in North America.},

	abstract = {Understanding patterns of microhabitat use among terrestrial salamanders is important for predicting their responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. The dependence of terrestrial salamanders on cutaneous respiration limits their spatial distribution to moist, humid areas. Although many studies have shown negative effects of canopy removal on terrestrial salamander abundance, some have shown potential ameliorating effects of retaining coarse woody debris (CWD) as moist refugia (critical resources in the landscape). Because cover objects like CWD retain moisture longer than ﬁne debris, terrestrial salamanders are often more locally abundant in areas of dense cover. Temporally variable environmental conditions could affect microhabitat quality and inﬂuence the ﬁne-scale spatial distributions of salamanders. Spatial and temporal variability in microhabitat use greatly inﬂuence individual detectability, which is always a challenge for terrestrial salamanders. We conducted repeated area-constrained surveys to examine variation in salamander microhabitat use of terrestrial salamanders in relation to season, year, and weather conditions. We found that time since rain (TSR) was the best predictor of relative salamander microhabitat use, but the strength of this relationship varied among years. In addition, TSR was also the best predictor of salamander surface activity. We captured most salamanders within leaf litter, but the proportion of leaf litter captures varied with TSR. Our results illustrate the importance of accounting for variable detectability when sampling for terrestrial salamanders. Disturbances which affect leaf litter depth and decomposition rates could inﬂuence the availability and quality of microhabitats and potentially increase competition among individuals for natural cover objects.},

	abstract = {Predicting how timber harvesting will inﬂuence sensitive taxa such as amphibians is of critical importance for sustainable management of forests. In 2004 and 2005, we studied the effects of four forestry treatments (clearcut with coarse woody debris [CWD] removed, clearcut with CWD retained, partial-cut of 50\% of canopy cover, and an uncut control) on movement, habitat selection, and abundance of amphibians in Maine. Four landscape-scale replicates of these four forestry treatments were created with each replicate centered on a breeding pool. A total of 8632 emerging juvenile wood frogs were captured and marked at drift fences encircling breeding pools, with 1166 marked wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), and 13,727 unmarked amphibians captured in drift fence/pitfall arrays at 16, 50, 100, and 150 m from the pools. Our capture results in the different treatments were consistent with previous studies in showing that adult abundance and habitat use differed among species, with wood frogs, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum), and eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) preferring uncut and partial-cut habitat, and adult green frogs (Rana clamitans) and American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) being more tolerant of clearcutting. Spotted salamanders also showed reduced captures with partial canopy removal and increased captures with the retention of CWD. Our results for juvenile amphibians differed from previous research, with lower captures of all study species (statistically signiﬁcant for seven of nine species) in clearcuts compared to uncut and partial-cut treatments. Clearcuts did not reduce habitat permeability for the low number of marked wood frogs that entered these treatments. Data from marked wood frogs also suggest that both density of conspeciﬁcs and habitat quality can inﬂuence habitat selection, and potentially dispersal of juvenile amphibians. The avoidance of clearcuts by juveniles of all study species suggests that this silvicultural technique may reduce both abundance and dispersal of many species, rather than just species where adults are known to be forest-dependent. Species may also be affected by partial as well as full canopy removal, and the retention of CWD may play a role in mitigating some of the effects of clearcutting.},

Despite the historical recognition that amphibians could play an important role in the movement of biomass and nutrients, very few studies have provided reliable estimates of abundance and density of amphibians to reveal their true importance. Here, we provide robust estimates of abundance and density of a dominant species, the Southern Redback Salamander (Plethodon serratus Grobman, 1944), in the oak forest ecosystem of the Ozark Highlands in Missouri. We then use the abundance and density estimates to calculate biomass and nutrient content of salamanders at our study sites in the Ozark forests. Salamanders at the Sinkin Experimental Forest comprise a large amount of protein, energy, and nutrients that greatly exceed estimates derived some 35 years ago in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Our estimates (7 300 –12 900 salamanders·ha−1) are 2–4 times greater than the values reported by Burton and Likens (1975a, Ecology, 56: 1068–1080; 1975b, Copeia, 1975: 541–546). Furthermore, we show that density estimates of other small plethodontid species reported in the literature are nearly an order of magnitude greater than that reported by Burton and Likens. We believe this indicates that previous results have underestimated the importance of salamander biomass, nutrient, and energy ﬂux, and their functional role in regulating invertebrates and carbon retention in forest ecosystems.},

We tested the functional redundancy of novel tree communities by verifying if six pairs of congeneric European and North American tree species bearing similar leaf litter traits resulted in similar ecological filters influencing the assembly of springtail (Collembola) communities at two sites. Litter biogeographic origin (native versus non-native) did not influence springtail community structure, but litter genus, which generally reflected trait differences, did.

In boreal forests, managers are increasingly considering intensifying woody biomass removal for bioenergy, but associated functional eﬀects on soil fauna that use microhabitats associated with this biomass remain poorly understood. Two years after harvesting, we assessed the eﬀects of an increasing intensity gradient of biomass removal in a northeastern Ontario jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stand on the functional structure of Collembola and Oribatida communities, two abundant soil taxa. The gradient ranged from (1) uncut forest to (2) stem-only harvesting to intense biomass removal through (3) wholetree harvesting (stem, top and branches) with (4) stump removal and (5) additional removal of organic soil strata. Morphological and life-history response traits associated with hypothesized functions were measured to determine changes in the functional structure (species trait diversity and composition) of communities in response to the gradient and related environmental changes. We found that functional structure of communities of both taxa was overall signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by biomass removal through a compositional shift in species traits in comparison to uncut forest. Functional homogenization was observed for Oribatida communities with a loss of species that were surface-dwelling, larger, predominantly sexually reproducing and mostly micro-detritivorous. In contrast, Collembola communities were less aﬀected with only the most extreme treatment showing a more homogenized community than the uncut forest. These functional changes were mainly explained by fewer suitable microhabitats, characterized for example by a more stable microclimate as well as more abundant and diverse food resources, due to the disturbance of forest ﬂoor organic cover with harvesting. To improve sustainable management of boreal forests, long-term studies will be needed to assess if partial functional homogenization of soil mesofauna by intensive practices persists through time and may inﬂuence soil ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Woody biomass is increasingly harvested in Canadian boreal forests as a source of bioenergy. However, there is concern over the environmental sustainability of harvesting practices. Our study assessed how forest ﬂoor mesofauna communities responded to an increasing intensity gradient of biomass removal and soil disturbance in a jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forest in northeastern Ontario, and whether any modiﬁcation in community structure could be related to environmental change. Five experimental treatments were established that included a mature jack pine control stand (no recent harvesting) and harvesting of stem-only, whole-tree (stem, top and branches), whole-tree with stump removal and whole-tree with stump and forest ﬂoor (organic layer) removal. Two years after treatment application, we compared the structure of Collembola and Oribatida communities in moss, organic and mineral soil samples along this gradient. Despite both taxa showing somewhat contrasting responses, in general, each community had signiﬁcantly lower density and species richness (α-diversity) and more compositional dissimilarities in response to biomass removal compared to uncut mature stands. These diﬀerences were especially marked in the two most intense removal treatments (whole-tree harvesting with stump removal and that with the additional forest ﬂoor removal). We attributed this result to the major loss of surface-dwelling species after harvesting and along the biomass removal gradient, especially in Oribatida communities, likely due to the loss of favourable microhabitats provided by moss and woody debris. Environmental changes observed along the gradient, beyond the loss of these microhabitats, were driven by the removal of forest ﬂoor decreasing soil nutrient richness and acidity and increasing soil temperature. Forest ﬂoor mesofaunal communities were clearly modiﬁed by more intensive biomass removal practices as compared to stem-only and whole-tree biomass harvesting. Long-term studies will be needed to investigate to what extent these patterns vary through time in order to inform sustainable management of woody biomass removal in this ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Abstract   In North American boreal forests, woody biomass is increasingly becoming an attractive bioenergy feedstock as it represents a more renewable, and low carbon alternative to fossil fuel. However, concerns over the ecological sustainability of an intensification of biomass harvesting over the long term remain. We assessed the effects of a gradient of biomass removal established 20years ago in five jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stands across northeastern Ontario on the taxonomic and functional structure of ground-dwelling Collembola and Oribatida communities. Essential to soil functioning, these two major taxa of mesofauna are dependent on microhabitats and food supply such as fungi provided by woody debris. Three treatments were considered including stem-only harvesting, whole-tree harvesting (stem, tops and branches removed), and blading (whole-tree harvesting plus removal of stump and forest floor). Adjacent uncut mature (±90year-old) stands were considered as reference state conditions (i.e. the endpoint of stand development following stand replacing disturbance). Soil mesofauna were collected and environmental variables measured across all treatments. We identified species of both taxa and measured a suite of functional response traits such as body length and reproduction strategy. Compared to mature uncut forests, soil mesofaunal communities remained modified 20years after biomass harvesting, notably in the most intense practice (blading). Treatment effects were more evident in Oribatida communities both taxonomically (lower density, biomass, species diversity and shifted composition) and functionally (lower diversity and modified trait composition resulting from fewer surface-dwelling, fast-dispersing and micro-detritivorous species) than in Collembola communities. This taxa-specific response may reflect generally shorter lifespans, higher reproduction rates and faster dispersal of Collembola than Oribatida. Incomplete recovery of mesofauna was consistent with persistent modifications of soil environmental conditions in harvested plots, notably after blading. Modifications included a reduced organic cover (ground vegetation, mosses and woody debris) as well as lower organic soil thickness and moisture, which likely resulted in fewer suitable microhabitats for many species. Using complementary taxonomic and trait-based approaches to highlight the underlying mechanisms of mesofaunal responses, our study revealed that recovery is incomplete within 20years after intensive biomass removal in these boreal conifer-dominated stands, and is likely linked to stand development and associated processes. As a result, longer-term monitoring will be required to track mesofaunal community recovery through these later developmental stages.},

	abstract = {Abstract   Replacement of native deciduous forests by coniferous stands was a common consequence of former European afforestation policies. However, these changes have proven to lead to serious ecological problems. Therefore, re-establishing mixed forests with native tree species became an increasingly popular management strategy to fulfil the demands of multi-functional forestry. We report about changes in collembolan assemblages and microbial performances during conversion of pure coniferous stands to mixed forests. The study was carried out in the Black forest area (SW of Germany), where a gradient of conversion from pure spruce stands (S1) to equally mixed stands (spruce, beech, and fir) at S4, through two intermediate stages (S2 and S3) was selected. Results clearly indicated strong modifications of the collembolan communities with an enrichment of the assemblages over the course of the conversion process. Mean species richness increased by 47\% from S1 to S4 accompanied by diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson) higher at S4. Significantly different soil biota assemblages were found at each phase of the conversion process. Spatial turnover and nestedness contribute almost equally to the modification of assemblages from S1 to S2 while later on in the mixing process only spatial turnover was acting. Concomitantly, significant shifts in the functional structure of the collembolan assemblages were depicted, deep-dwelling collembolan (euedaphic) being, surprisingly, the most responsive group. In contrast, neither microbial nor coarse environmental parameters were influenced by the factor “conversion phase”. We suggest that stimulation of Collembolan communities after the mixing process was mainly due to the input of more suitable food sources and/or microhabitat increases. Our findings underline the crucial role of aboveground processes on the belowground system, with the intensity and scheme of the mixing-process as important factors to consider when aiming at soil biodiversity improvement in forest systems.},

Occupancy models have emerged as a popular approach for inferring species occurrence because they account for problems associated with imperfect detection in field surveys. Current models, however, are limited because they assume ­covariates are independent (i.e., indirect effects do not occur). Here, we combined structural equation and occupancy models to investigate complex influences on species occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection. These two methods are inherently compatible because they both provide means to make inference on latent or unobserved quantities based on observed data. Our models evaluated the direct and indirect roles of cattle grazing, water chemistry, vegetation, nonnative fishes, and pond permanence on the ­occurrence of six pond-breeding amphibians, two of which are threatened: the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and the California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii). While cattle had strong effects on pond vegetation and water chemistry, their overall effects on amphibian occurrence were small compared to the consistently negative effects of nonnative fish. Fish strongly reduced occurrence probabilities for four of five native amphibians, including both species of conservation concern. These results could help to identify drivers of amphibian declines and to prioritize strategies for amphibian conservation. More generally, this approach facilitates a more mechanistic representation of ideas about the causes of species distributions in space and time. As shown here, occupancy modeling and structural equation modeling are readily combined, and bring rich sets of techniques that may provide unique theoretical and applied insights into basic ecological questions.},

	abstract = {Global change is reshaping climatic conditions at a tempo that exceeds natural migration rates for most tree species. As climate change amplifies the disparity between species’ adaptive capacity and local climates, tree populations risk becoming geographically stranded in increasingly unsuitable conditions. This mismatch may cause catastrophic losses of key forest ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, habitat provisioning, and forest products. In response, forest managers and researchers are developing a suite of climate-adaptive strategies designed to sustain forest diversity and function. Among these, forest assisted migration (FAM) involves the movement of planting stock from source populations to locations either within or beyond their current ranges. The goal is to establish forests that can survive in today's climate and expected to thrive in future conditions, thereby sustaining ecosystem good and services. Because FAM is still in its infancy, implementation is limited by many uncertainties. Climatically derived seed sourcing is needed to ensure that planting stock possesses the ecophysiological amplitude to withstand both current and future climatic conditions at the destination site. Additionally, more knowledge about the impacts of local herbivores and intraspecific competition are needed because these drivers will co-regulate seedling success along with climate. Practically, these uncertainties must be addressed to instill in managers sufficient confidence that FAM investments will fulfill long-term management and societal goals relative to other silvicultural approaches. The Desired REgeneration through Assisted Migration (DREAM) framework is an international collaboration that uses basic and applied research to reduce these uncertainties and derive climate-informed planting approaches. DREAM is self-reinforcing in that each step in the process informs and strengthens subsequent phases. Namely, it sources seed in a climatically informed manner, experimentally tests this sourced stock to probe for physiological maladaptation under controlled settings, grows the stock in the field under a range of silvicultural scenarios, and finally forecasts long-term outcomes using models parameterized from the controlled- and field-tests. In this paper, we describe the DREAM framework and illustrate aspects of its implementation drawing from two experimental sites: one in Québec, Canada and one in Wisconsin, USA. Moreover, we place the DREAM study into the broader FAM context by briefly contrasting it with other operational examples throughout North America. Knowledge gained from this research-management collaboration will expand current reforestation paradigms to include future climate-adaptive ones that aim to use the right seed, planted in the right places, under the right conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract   Terrestrial salamander abundance in North American forests is closely associated with forest characteristics, and salamander populations typically decline following timber removal. However, salamander responses to timber harvest vary considerably from one study to the next – some studies have shown limited or no effects whereas others have found harvest-related declines of up to 95\%. To estimate overall effect sizes of timber harvest on salamander populations and to examine factors that contribute to variation in salamander responses to harvest, we carried out a meta-analysis of published studies of the effects of timber harvesting on terrestrial salamander abundance. Based on 108 salamander species/treatment combinations from 24 studies, we found mean harvest-related declines ranged from 29\% (95\% CI=−2\% to 51\%) for long-term responses to partial canopy removal to 62\% (95\% CI=29\% to 80\%) for short-term responses to clearcutting. Multivariate mixed models suggested that clearcutting had a modestly greater impact on salamander populations than partial harvest and that decreases following harvest were more pronounced at sites with warmer summer high temperatures. In addition, active sampling of salamanders (e.g., surface counts) led to greater apparent effects of timber harvest than passive sampling (e.g., cover boards or pitfall traps), suggesting that sampling methodology influenced the perceived effects of harvest. In the studies evaluated, salamander numbers almost always declined following timber removal, but salamanders were never extirpated and populations typically increased as forests regenerated.},

Although the impact of clear-cutting has received much attention, the widely-used practice of selective logging (in which individual trees or small groups of trees are removed leaving gaps in the forest canopy) has been incompletely studied. We examined the effects of such logging on the distributions of individual redback salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, in a mixed deciduous forest that had been harvested 1 yr earlier. Salamander densities and distributions were assessed using thorough searches of leaf litter and cover objects in quadrats along transects which passed from gaps into the surrounding forest. Comparisons were made between quadrats in three location categories: inside the gaps, along gap edges, and within the forest. We found much variation in salamander numbers among transects, but detected no significant differences in the densities of salamanders among the three location categories. Similarly, salamanders did not show different degrees of within-quadrat grouping among the location categories. These results suggest that the newly formed gaps produced by selective logging did not strongly affect the distributions of P. cinereus in the first year following harvest.},

	volume = {126},
	doi = {10.1111/oik.03677},
	abstract = {Plant–soil interactions are increasingly recognized to play a major role in terrestrial ecosystems functioning. However, few studies to date have focused on slow dynamic ecosystems such as forests. As they are vertically stratified by multiple vegetation strata, canopy tree removal by thinning operations could alter forest plant community through tree canopy opening. Very little is known about cascading effects on soil biodiversity.

We conducted a large-scale, multi-site assessment of collembolan assemblage response to long-term canopy tree removal in sessile oak Quercus petraea temperate forests. A total of 33 experimental plots were studied covering a large gradient of canopy tree basal area, stand age and local abiotic contexts.

Collembolan abundance strongly declined with canopy tree removal in early forest successional stage and this was mediated by negative effect of understory plant community composition changes, i.e. shift from moss and forb to tree seedling, fern, shrub and grass species. Negative effect of this composition shift on collembolan species richness was largely offset by positive effect of the increase in understory plant species richness. This gives support to both the plant mass-ratio and functional diversity hypotheses. Collembolan functional groups had contrasting response patterns, which were mediated by different ecological factors. Epedaphic (r-strategist) abundance and species richness increased with canopy tree removal in relation with the increase in understory plant species richness. In contrast, euedaphic (K-strategist) abundance and species richness declined with canopy tree removal in early forest successional stage in relation with changes in understory plant community composition and species richness, as well as microclimatic conditions.

Overall, our study provides experimental evidence that forest plant community can be a strong driver of collembolan assemblages. It also emphasizes the role of trees as foundation species of forest ecosystems that can shape soil biodiversity through their regulation of understory plant community and ecosystem abiotic conditions.},

	doi = {10.1111/2041-210x.13858},
	abstract = {Large-scale, long-term biodiversity monitoring is essential to conservation, land management and identifying threats to biodiversity. However, multispecies surveys are prone to various types of observation error, including false-positive/false-negative detection and misclassification, where a species is thought to have been encountered but not correctly identified. Previous methods assume an imperfect classifier produces species-level classifications, but in practice, particularly with human observers, we may end up with extraspecific classifications including ‘unknown’, morphospecies designations and taxonomic identifications coarser than species. Disregarding these types of species misclassification in biodiversity monitoring datasets can bias estimates of ecologically important quantities such as demographic rates, occurrence and species richness. Here we present a joint classification-occupancy model that accounts for species non-detection and misclassification. Our framework accommodates extinction and colonization dynamics, allows for additional uncertain ‘morphospecies’ designations and makes use of individual specimens with known species identities in a semi-supervised setting. We compare the performance of our model to a classification-only model that discards information about occupancy and encounter rate. We illustrate our model with an empirical case study of the carabid beetle (Carabidae) community at the National Ecological Observatory Network Niwot Ridge Mountain Research Station, near Boulder, CO, USA. We also use simulations to evaluate model performance through validation metrics where varying fractions of the data are confirmed. The model supported imperfect classifier accuracy and favoured certain true species classifications strongly for some morphospecies. The model outperformed (e.g. precision) the reduced model that discarded occupancy information, and these differences were most pronounced for abundant species. Spatial and temporal dynamics from modelled occupancy and encounter rates may inform species misclassification probability, but this idea has not yet been tested. Our statistical framework explores this opportunity, and can be applied to datasets with imperfect species detection and classification, limited verification data and non-species classifications.},

Here, C stocks were estimated for a northern temperate mixed forest located in eastern Québec, Canada, five years after clear-cutting and partial-cutting, either with or without a brushing treatment to control the competing vegetation. The biomass of the aboveground vegetation (trees, saplings, understory), litter and woody debris (coarse, small, fine), as well as the roots (diameter ≤ 1.5 cm) was evaluated. Additionally, soil C pools up to a depth of 35 cm of the mineral soil were assessed. Total ecosystem C stocks were influenced by the overstory treatments reflecting harvest intensities. Although the belowground C pools were major contributors to total ecosystem C stocks, silvicultural treatments only influenced forest floor and aboveground C stocks.

	abstract = {Salamanders represent exceptional indicators for understanding environmental change and forest degradation. Coverboards, a type of artificial cover object, have become a popular tool for censusing salamanders given their low cost of installation and lack of danger to the environment and animals. Previous work has suggested that a variety of factors including wood type, coverboard size and thickness, and array design may impact coverboard usage by salamanders, potentially confounding results. Therefore, when comparing salamander counts across studies, or even within multi-year studies, it is necessary to standardize study designs. We assessed how coverboard age and the coverboard aging process affects coverboard usage by red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), using arrays composed of boards with three different ages (zero, one, and five-year old boards) in Palmer, Massachusetts from 2017–2019. We found that there was no difference in salamander preference for zero- or one-year old boards, but there was a strong preference for five-year old boards. We also found that board aging does not strongly impact preference. Factors such as snout-vent length and age class were not significantly correlated with board age. For multi-year studies greater than two years, we recommend either replacing boards every 2–3 years before they become significantly more attractive to salamanders or weathering boards for greater than two years prior to deploying them. Ensuring comparable study designs will likely eliminate many of the conflicting results that are found in coverboard literature and we echo many workers who call for standardization.},

	abstract = {Abstract   Forest fragmentation by management activities has been implicated in the decline of forest biodiversity. Even though boreal ecosystems are generally deemed quite resilient to disturbance effects, high contemporary levels of disturbance might push forest-interior species toward decline or extinction. In this study, we examined beetle communities in forest patches of different sizes, including clearcuts, residual postharvest patches from 0.03 to 50ha in size, and large mature forest tracts ({\textgreater}1000ha). Overall, community structure follows a gradient between clearcuts and large mature forest tracts, even if patch size effects were more difficult to detect among patches {\textgreater}2.5ha. Beetles were most abundant in clearcuts, and species richness was highest in small tree groups (0.03–0.05ha). The effects of fragmentation were strongly conditioned by beetle feeding habits. Predators and xylophagous beetles were mostly associated with clearcuts or smaller patches (i.e., small tree groups or large tree groups [0.3–0.5ha]), whereas fungivorous beetles were associated with forest-interior habitats. Although many forest-interior species were still present in relatively small patches 1–5years after harvesting, negative effects of habitat fragmentation on these species might increase in the long-term.},

Although the two species are closely related, P. r. shenandoah grows to a longer body length and has a broader head. All age classes of P. r. Shenandoah emigrate out of the talus and are found within 3 m of the talus edge, but only adults which are as large as or larger than the largest P. cinereus are able to survive farther than about 3 m from the talus. This distribution is not explained by a tendency for large adults to wander more than juveniles. The large P. r. Shenandoah in the soil take prey that are significantly larger than prey taken by cohabiting P. cinereus, indicating that food may be the limited resource for which competition occurs. Both species are euryphagic and prey upon the same taxa of small animals. Food is periodically limited in availability, but not in abundance. Following a rain, salamanders forage freely and consume a large quantity of prey, based on stomach contents, but prey become increasingly unavailable as the soil and leaf litter dry and the salamanders are restricted to isolated pockets of moisture. Stomachs remain virtually empty until the next rain, at which time they are full again indicating that the abundance of prey is not greatly affected by the intervening dryness. Food may periodically become a limited resource during long dry seasons and as such may affect the survival of the salamanders or their ability to produce eggs.},

These may include ultraviolet radiation, predation, habitat modification, environmental acidity and toxicants, diseases, changes in climate or weather patterns, and interactions among these factors. Understanding the extent of the problem and its nature requires an understanding of how local factors affect the dynamics of local populations. Hypotheses about population behavior must be tested against appropriate null hypotheses. We generated null hypotheses for the behavior of amphibian populations using a model, and we used them to test hypotheses about the behavior of 85 time series taken from the literature. Our results suggest that most amphibian populations should decrease more often than they increase, due to highly variable recruitment and less variable adult mortality. During the period covered by our data (1951–1997), more amphibian populations decreased than our model predicted. However, there was no indication that the proportion of populations decreasing changed over time. In addition, our review of the literature suggests that many if not most amphibians exist in metapopulations. Understanding the dynamics of amphibian populations will require an integration of studies on and within local populations and at the metapopulation level.},

We investigated the role of Ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii ) in regulating invertebrate numbers and leaf litter retention in a northern California forest. Our objective was to examine how salamander predation on invertebrates affects leaf litter retention and the amount available for soil-building and carbon capture at the litter-soil interface. We used field enclosures to quantify the effects of Ensatina on invertebrates and litter retention over two wet seasons, using moisture as a covariate. In the first year Ensatina reduced Coleoptera (beetles) and Diptera (flies) larvae .2 mm, adult Coleoptera, Collembola (springtails), and Formicidae (ants), and increased Oribatid mites, larvae ,2 mm (Diptera and Coleoptera), Diplopoda (millipedes), and Aranaea (spiders) ,2 mm by reducing their competitors and predators. A single Ensatina in a 1.5m2 enclosure increased litter retention by 13.3\% 6 3.6\% (mean 6 SE) compared to controls, facilitating the capture of 200 kg/ha of carbon. At a similar density range-wide this would equate to 72.3 metric tons/yr of carbon in one season potentially sequestered in forest soil rather than entering the atmosphere. In the second year invertebrate densities doubled in response to early rains such that while salamanders reduced the numbers of the same taxa, effect sizes were lower compared to year one, producing biological effects that failed to achieve statistical significance. However, three taxa did significantly increase in year two (Annelida [worms], Psocoptera [barklice], and Chelonethida [pseudoscorpions]). Litter retention in year two was greater on treatment plots by 5.6\% 6 4.6\%; however, high variability across plots precluded statistical significance. Ensatina suppressed some invertebrate taxa, released others, increased leaf litter retention, and facilitated greater carbon capture in both years; however, the strength of the effects were modulated by the bottom-up effects of the timing and amount of precipitation in year two.},

	abstract = {We investigated whether the trophic ecology of an apex predator is inﬂuenced by ecosystem-level nutrient depletion. The feeding behavior and nutrient assimilation of a terrestrial salamander, Eastern Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus (Green, 1818)), was surveyed along a gradient of forest biogeochemistry. Recent studies have documented populations of these salamanders in forests with low-pH soils that were long thought to be fatal. One mechanism that may enable P. cinereus to tolerate acid-impaired habitats is its generalist life history. We sampled diet, invertebrate prey abundance, and tissue composition of P. cinereus from sites that range in calcium availability and soil pH in northern forests of North America. We found that P. cinereus consistently exhibited a generalist feeding strategy, having diverse diets closely representing resource availability. Prey abundances were unrelated to the biogeochemical gradient (excluding gastropods), indicating relatively intact food webs. Although P. cinereus at the two most acid-impaired sites consumed more prey, overall trophic strategies were consistent across the gradient. Salamander tissue composition was unrelated to variation in forest biogeochemistry, although manganese levels were elevated in the most acid-impaired forests. We suggest that a generalist feeding strategy, combined with diverse and compositionally stable food webs, facilitates tolerance by this abundant predator of the challenges imposed by acid-impaired habitats.},

	abstract = {Intraguild predation in structurally complex habitats is thought to weaken trophic cascades and increase food web stability. However, many predators commonly found in leaf litter become restricted to simple microhabitat beneath rocks and logs during periods between rains. It is within this structurally simple microhabitat that some predators defend rich prey resources and are likely to interact strongly as the surrounding forest becomes too dry to forage broadly in space. We conducted a 4-y press experiment where we removed focal predators from unfenced field plots. To evaluate the effects of predators on one another we removed either salamanders or centipedes from beneath artificially placed cover objects and compared abundances of these and other intraguild predators to those in non-removal controls. We predicted that salamanders and centipedes would have strong negative effects on each other and on carabid beetles and spiders. We removed a total of 1288 salamanders and 1056 centipedes over 98 sampling dates. In salamander removal plots spider abundance increased by 34\%, and carabid beetles decreased by 15\% relative to the control. In centipede removal plots salamanders increased by 18\% and carabid beetles increased by 29\%, but spider abundance decreased by 15\%. Interaction strengths were strongest in the drier summer months when territorial predators were confined in spatially fixed microhabitats. It is during these periods that predators may strongly regulate the abundances of guild members. In territorial species that defend areas beneath natural cover, the effect of intraguild predators may be an important mechanism that regulates distribution and abundance of forest floor predators.},

Despite the recognition that salamanders have the potential to strongly affect ecosystem function through both direct and indirect pathways, little is known regarding the nature of interactions between small vertebrates and the large, predatory arthropods with which they share both microhabitat and prey. Our study was designed to explore interactions between Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, and spiders in the genus Wadotes in an eastern North American temperate forest ecosystem. We were particularly interested in teasing apart behaviors such as territoriality and intraguild predation in an attempt to determine specifically which interaction is most likely responsible for the observed negative relationship between salamander and spider abundance at our field site. Field data indicate that P. cinereus and large syntopic spiders exhibit negative spatial associations in the microhabitat beneath cover objects, a possible indication of interspecific territoriality. In our laboratory experiments, resident salamanders displayed agonistic postures similarly toward both intruding conspecifics and spiders, suggesting that salamanders may perceive large intruding spiders as competitors. Finally, we observed no injuries to individual P. cinereus or adult spiders even though occasional chases and bites by both were recorded during the behavioral trials. We found no evidence that adults or juveniles of P. cinereus were envenomated by adult Wadotes spp., and there were no instances of intraguild predation in this study. Multiple lines of evidence from this study, and others, suggest that the primary interaction between individuals of P. cinereus and large spiders is competitive in nature rather than predatory. We suggest that the cost associated with intraguild predation on salamanders with noxious skin secretions may preclude them from being preyed upon by spiders.},

Recent studies suggest that interactions among intraguild predators, such as terrestrial salamanders and large arthropods, might be important for the regulation of detritivores, fungivores, and perhaps detritus within terrestrial webs. A key prediction is that interactions among predators weaken trophic cascades. Our research examined this prediction by removing predators for 4 yr from unfenced field plots to investigate the effects on litter arthropods, the microbial community, and rates of leaf litter decomposition. We manipulated predator abundance in three treatments (salamander removal, centipede removal, and multiple predator removal) compared to a control in which no predators were removed. Despite difficulties in suppressing centipede numbers, we observed increases in salamanders, millipedes, isopods, slugs, numbers of ant colonies, and gamasid mites in the centipede removal plots. Additionally, several phospholipid fatty acid markers for bacteria were suppressed in plots where salamanders were most abundant. Finally, we detected treatment effects on the rate of litter disappearance from leaf bags in our field plots: those with the most salamanders had the lowest levels of litter decomposition. Overall, we found some evidence for top-down effects of predators in a temperate forest-floor web. Our study is one of few that have employed an unfenced field design and the only study examining the effects of salamanders on forest soil microbes. The results contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating that territorial predators, such as terrestrial salamanders, can be strong regulators of species composition at lower trophic levels in a system that is commonly thought to be regulated primarily through bottom-up effects of organic matter supply.},

Predators can affect ecosystem functions through a combination of top-down trophic cascades and bottom-up effects on nutrient dynamics. As the most abundant vertebrate predator in many eastern US forests, woodland salamanders (Plethodon spp.) likely affect ecosystems functions. We examined the effects of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) on a variety of forest ecosystem functions using a combined approach of large-scale salamander removals (314-m2 plots) and small-scale enclosures (2 m2) where we explicitly manipulated salamander density (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 m22). In these experiments, we measured the rates of litter and wood decomposition, potential nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates, acorn germination, and foliar insect damage on red oak seedlings. Across both experimental venues, we found no significant effect of red-backed salamanders on any of the ecosystem functions. We also found no effect of salamanders on intraguild predator abundance (carabid beetles, centipedes, spiders). Our study adds to the already conflicting evidence on effects of red-backed salamander and other amphibians on terrestrial ecosystem functions. It appears likely that the impact of terrestrial amphibians on ecosystem functions is context dependent. Future research would benefit from explicitly examining terrestrial amphibian effects on ecosystem functions under a variety of environmental conditions and in different forest types.},

Despite the historical recognition that amphibians could play an important role in the movement of biomass and nutrients, very few studies have provided reliable estimates of abundance and density of amphibians to reveal their true importance. Here, we provide robust estimates of abundance and density of a dominant species, the Southern Redback Salamander (Plethodon serratus Grobman, 1944), in the oak forest ecosystem of the Ozark Highlands in Missouri. We then use the abundance and density estimates to calculate biomass and nutrient content of salamanders at our study sites in the Ozark forests. Salamanders at the Sinkin Experimental Forest comprise a large amount of protein, energy, and nutrients that greatly exceed estimates derived some 35 years ago in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Our estimates (7 300 –12 900 salamanders·ha−1) are 2–4 times greater than the values reported by Burton and Likens (1975a, Ecology, 56: 1068–1080; 1975b, Copeia, 1975: 541–546). Furthermore, we show that density estimates of other small plethodontid species reported in the literature are nearly an order of magnitude greater than that reported by Burton and Likens. We believe this indicates that previous results have underestimated the importance of salamander biomass, nutrient, and energy ﬂux, and their functional role in regulating invertebrates and carbon retention in forest ecosystems.},

I tested this hypothesis during a 6-yr study of the effects of the Eastern Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus) on the invertebrate community of a forest site in northeast Ohio. Salamander surface density, invertebrate abundance, and community composition were monitored within 30 open, circular plots. Variation in plot occupancy by P. cinereus was achieved by supplying plots with differing amounts of artiﬁcial cover (0, 1, or 4 ceramic tiles) that served as refuges for the salamanders. Salamander plot occupancy, invertebrate density, leaf litter mass, and leaf litter moisture were quantiﬁed each spring and fall from 2003 through 2008. Statistically signiﬁcant effects of salamander plot-occupancy on invertebrate densities were found for several taxa of mesofauna, including several Collembola taxa, oribatid mites, pseudoscorpions, and psocoptera. The strength and direction of salamander effects varied among taxa and included negative, positive, and no effects on invertebrate densities. The magnitude and sign of salamander effects on invertebrate densities were predicted by seasonal and interannual variation in leaf litter mass and, to a lesser extent, litter moisture content. Salamander effects decreased with increasing litter mass and were more often negative when litter mass was high, whereas positive effects on invertebrate densities were more likely when litter mass was low. For several taxa, the positive effect of P. cinereus also increased with litter moisture. I propose two mechanistic hypotheses for these dynamics that integrate behavioral ecology of salamander prey selection and territorial defense with variation in litter mass and litter moisture.},

We also explored the relationship between rare and dominant taxa and species characteristics as they relate to dispersal capacity and use of within-stand habitat features such as coarse woody debris. We found no relationship between life-history characteristics (such as body size, wing morphology, or reported associations with downed wood) and the relative abundance or frequency of occurrence of species.

	abstract = {Summary   The red-backed salamander, Plethodon cinereus, is an abundant predator in northeastern North America, where it is hypothesized to play an important role in the regulation of forest-floor invertebrate communities. We tested the hypothesis that the top–down effects of P. cinereus are influenced by the species composition of invertebrates of the forest-floor. In a month-long microcosm experiment, we compared salamander effects on invertebrate species composition in leaf-litter from two sites that differed in species and size composition of invertebrate detritivores (an urban forest site at which isopods and millipedes were numerous and a rural forest site at which Collembola were the most numerous detritivores, but isopods and millipedes were few). Our results were consistent with our initial hypothesis. The presence of salamanders within microcosms was associated with decreased densities of oribatid mites, pseudoscorpions, isopods and millipedes in comparison to salamander-absent controls, but negative effects of salamanders on isopods and millipedes were most strongly expressed within urban litter microcosms. Salamanders were also associated with a positive, indirect effect, i.e., an increase in density of podomorphic Collembola in comparison to salamander-absent controls, but within urban litter exclusively. Our results suggested that plethodontid salamanders exerted positive, indirect effects through consumption of an intermediate predator, i.e., pseudoscorpions, and macroinvertebrate competitors, i.e., isopods and millipedes, of podomorphic Collembola. We hypothesize that differences in salamander-mediated dynamics between the two litter sources resulted from prey selection by P. cinereus based on differences in prey size and abundance between the rural and urban forest litter.},

	abstract = {Environmental temperatures affect nearly all aspects of ectotherm physiology, including terrestrial salamanders. Therefore, habitat disturbances that alter temperature regimes may interact with physiological processes to affect energy budgets of salamanders or constrain surface activity and possibly lead to changes in population-level parameters. We hypothesized that warmer surface temperatures following harvesting of canopy trees could cause surface-active salamanders to expend more energy for metabolism, potentially leaving a smaller proportion of the energy budget available for reproduction or storage. From 2006 to 2008, we quantified temperature regimes of salamander refugia in a field experiment replicated at 4 sites that included plots subjected to a timber harvest and plots not manipulated during this time period. At each site, we quantified temperature regimes in regenerating forest stands which, approximately 10 years earlier, experienced a range of harvest intensity from shelterwood to silvicultural clearcut. Further, we compared energetic parameters including 1) calories required to maintain homeostasis across an active season, 2) abundance of available potential energy (i.e., invertebrate prey), and 3) a measure of growth and storage (i.e., body condition index) among silvicultural treatments for surface-active salamanders. For surface-active eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), mean calories required for maintenance were approxi- mately 33\% greater in recently harvested forest compared to unharvested controls, but body condition was inconsistent among treatments, and invertebrate abundances were similar among treatments but differed by study site. In contrast, we did not detect a treatment effect in any energetic metric 8-14 growing seasons after harvesting. Given that surface-active salamanders in recently harvested forest may be forced to restrain behaviors associated with foraging and mating or trade-off growth or reproduction for increased basic maintenance costs, energetics may be an important but overlooked short-term contributor to observed changes in abundances, reproductive demography, or surface activities after timber harvesting. Managing for both the rapid recovery of understory vegetation and retention of large stumps and logs may help mitigate warming of microclimate for salamanders and should be considered further. 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

Both soil compaction and organic matter removal re- duced the density of soil mesofauna. Stem-only harvesting reduced total mesofauna densities by 20\% relative to uncut forest values. A combination of whole-tree harvest and forest floor removal with heavy soil compaction significantly reduced total soil mesofauna densities by 93\% relative to the uncut forest control. Removal of the forest floor repre- sents a substantial loss of habitat for most soil mesofauna. The forest floor apparently buffered the mineral soil by lim- iting both the impact of soil compaction and fluctuations in soil temperature and moisture. The relative abundance of Prostigmata and Mesostigmata increased with treatment severity, whereas that of Oribatida decreased. Species richness of the oribatid mite fauna was reduced as the severity of treatments increased. The number of rare oribatid species (those representing {\textless}1\% of the total oribatid mite sample) decreased by 40\% or more relative to the uncut forest con- trol. Evenness also decreased as treatment severity increased. Oppiella nova and Suctobelbella sp. near acutidens were the dominant oribatid species in both the forest floor and mineral soil, regardless of treatment.

Predators such as gamasid mites, spiders and staphyliniid and cantharid beetles decreased by 30–50\% after WTH at both sites. Microbidetritivorous dipterans and fungivorous Collembola decreased at the pine site, but not at the more productive spruce site. Enchytraeids and nematodes were usually not affected by WTH. No differences in fungal and bacterial biomass were found. The removal of organic matter had fairly long-term, of the order of decades, effects on the soil food web. The effects were quantitative rather than qualitative. No functional groups disappeared after WTH. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that soil food webs are entirely donor-controlled. The more pronounced effects of WTH at higher trophic positions indicates that the major interactions in the food webs we have studied are reciprocal, i.e., that consumers to some degree control the density of their resources.},

In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and subcontinental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worstcase scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth.},

	doi = {10.1038/nature08649},
	abstract = {In the event of climate change, species have to move if they are to remain in an area with the same average temperature: their chances of survival therefore depend on the ability to keep pace with a moving climate as well as on the extent of change in temperature and other climate factors. To put this pressure on species into context, a novel index designed to quantify climate change in the coming century has been developed. Its value gives the local velocity along the Earth's surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and is derived from temperature gradients scaled by distance (°C per km) and time (°C per year). The index provides a quantitative view of the role of topography in buffering climate change as it would affect plants and animals: on the IPCC's A1B emission scenario the index has a global mean of 0.42 km per year, compared to extremes of 0.08 and 1.26 km per year for mountains forest biomes and flooded grasslands, respectively. Climate change velocity, it turns out, is large relative to species migration speeds and the sizes of protected habitats. The data suggest that, in some ecosystems, helping species to relocate more rapidly via habitat corridors or new reserves could be an important contribution to conservation. As the climate changes, species will have to move if they are to remain in an area with the same average temperature. Here, this required movement — termed the velocity of temperature change — is quantified. The results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change and suggest that montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century. The ranges of plants and animals are moving in response to recent changes in climate1. As temperatures rise, ecosystems with ‘nowhere to go’, such as mountains, are considered to be more threatened2,3. However, species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climate’s ultimate persistence4,5. Here we present a new index of the velocity of temperature change (km yr-1), derived from spatial gradients (°Ckm-1) and multimodel ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase (°Cyr-1) in the twenty-first century. This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earth’s surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and has a global mean of 0.42kmyr-1 (A1B emission scenario). Owing to topographic effects, the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08kmyr-1), temperate coniferous forest, and montane grasslands. Velocities are highest in flooded grasslands (1.26kmyr-1), mangroves and deserts. High velocities suggest that the climates of only 8\% of global protected areas have residence times exceeding 100years. Small protected areas exacerbate the problem in Mediterranean-type and temperate coniferous forest biomes. Large protected areas may mitigate the problem in desert biomes. These results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change. Montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century. Elsewhere, reduced emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas6, or efforts to increase species movement may be necessary7.},

	abstract = {We compared pitfall catches from four types of mature lodgepole pine—white spruce forest with those from five age classes of young forest regenerating subsequent to clear-cutting. Ground beetles were most abundant in the youngest sites (1–2 years since cutting) and in the mature stands on moist soil. Species richness was higher in regenerating sites than in mature forest. Cluster analysis grouped the ground-beetle fauna according to forest age and forest type, suggesting that there is a general pattern of recovery after logging. Responses of common species to forest cutting fell into three groups: (1) forest generalists (2 species) were not dramatically affected, (2) species of open habitat (27 species) appeared and/or increased in abundance, and (3) mature forest species (10 species) disappeared or decreased in abundance. Populations of many mature forest species appear to recover following logging, but several specialists did not recolonize even the oldest regenerating stands. Furthermore, fragmentation and creation of large areas of relatively homogeneous young forest stages through logging may have detrimental long-term effects even on the more abundant forest generalists. We must better understand subtle variations in habitat in order to maintain invertebrate diversity while harvesting the boreal forest.



Nosotros comparamos la captura de carabidos (Coleoptera: Carabidae), utilizando trampas de suelo, en cuatro tipos de bosques maduros de pino (Pinus contorta)—abeto blanco (Picea glauca), con aquella de cinco clases de bosques jovenes en regeneracion despues de tala indiscriminada. La abundancia de carabidos fue mayor en los sitios jovenes (1–2 anos despues de la tala), y en rodales maduros con suelo humedo. La riqueza de especies fue mayor en los sitios en regeneracion que en los bosques maduros. Analisis de agrupamiento (cluster analysis) separo la fauna de carabidos de acuerdo a la edad y al tipo de bosque, sugiriendo que despues de la tala existe un patron general de recuperacion. Las respuestas a la tala de especies comunes del bosque recayeron en tres grupos: (1) generalistas del bosque (2 especies) no fueron notablemente afectadas, (2) especies de habitats abiertos (27 especies) aparacieron y/o incrementaron en abundancia y (3) especies de bosques maduros (10 especies) desaparecieron o incrementaron en abundancia. Las poblaciones de muchas especies de bosques maduros parecen recuperarse despues de la tala, pero varias especialistas ni siquiera recolonizaron los rodales mas antiguos en regeneracion. Mas aun, la fragmentacion y creacion de extensas areas de bosques jovenes relativamente homogeneas a causa de la tala puede tener efectos adversos a largo plazo, aun para las especies generalistas mas abundantes del bosque.

A common trend is that large, poorlydispersing specialist species decrease with increased disturbance while smallgeneralist species with good dispersal ability increase. Some species are notaffected by moderate disturbance. There is, however, not enough research todetermine how suitable carabids are for biodiversity studies, or how well theyrepresent the response of other species.

	abstract = {Abstract   Amphibians have declined dramatically in many areas of the world. These declines seem to have worsened over the past 25 years and amphibians are now more threatened than either mammals or birds, though comparisons with other taxa are confounded by a shortage of reliable data. Research into amphibian declines has focused on: (1) documentation at the landscape or population level; and (2) observational and experimental work on potential causes of declines. Although loss of habitat is known to have impacted amphibians for decades, recent research has focused on the effects of environmental contaminants, UV-B irradiation, emerging diseases, the introduction of alien species, direct exploitation, and climate change. Such factors may interact with each other, but high levels of mortality do not necessarily lead to population declines. Major challenges remain in extrapolating from experimental data to population level effects, and in developing methodologies that will provide unbiased descriptions of amphibian population dynamics. Although amphibians have been widely advocated as good biological indicators, there is little evidence to suggest that they are more effective than other taxa as surrogate measures of biodiversity or habitat quality. As many of the threats facing amphibians are extremely difficult to neutralize in the short- to medium-term, the chances of ameliorating – let alone reversing – amphibian declines seem very poor.},

Our studies demonstrate that life stages related to oviposition and larval performance in the aquatic stage are sometimes affected positively by clearcutting, whereas effects on juvenile and adult terrestrial stages are mostly negative. Partial harvest treatments produced both positive and weaker negative responses than clearcut treatments.

Effective implementation of assisted migration can only occur if target transfer guidelines are developed because our current seed transfer guidelines, established to guide the movement of plant materials, lack inherent spatial and temporal dynamics associated with climate change. This limitation restrains reforestation practitioners from making decisions about assisted migration. Lack of operating procedures, uncertainties about future climate conditions, risks associated with moving plants outside their current ranges, and existing policies have hampered formal actions in forest management and conservation.

Natural resource managers in many areas are also challenged by scant locally or regionally relevant information on climate projections and potential impacts. The Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) project was designed to respond to these barriers to operationalizing climate adaptation strategies by providing a multiregion network of replicated operational-scale research sites testing ecosystem-specific climate change adaptation treatments across a gradient of adaptive approaches, and introducing conceptual tools and processes to integrate climate change considerations into management and silvicultural decisionmaking. Here we present the framework of the ASCC project, highlight the implementation process at two of the study sites, and discuss the contributions of this collaborative science-management partnership.Management and Policy Implications The shortage of scientifically robust, replicated, operational-scale research on forest adaptation to climate change has left forest and natural resource managers with little information on and few examples of on-the-ground adaptation approaches that could work for their forest ecosystems. The Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) project is establishing a national network of long-term silvicultural research sites across multiple regions and a diversity of forest types to test a range of adaptation approaches and to provide managers with the tangible demonstrations needed to inform climate-adaptive decisionmaking in their forest management. Furthermore, the ASCC project provides managers and scientists with training on integrating climate change considerations into planning processes and identifying locally appropriate adaptation approaches and tactics. The main goals of the ASCC project ultimately serve to advance understanding within the forest management community of how management can foster adaptive responses to the impacts of uncertain climate futures. The science-management partnerships built through this project help inform the relevance of the research, as well as advance communication on climate change adaptation at a national scale.},

Though the growth rate of global CO2 emissions has slowed and many countries have strengthened their emissions targets, current mid-century net-zero goals are insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures. The primary barriers to the achievement of a 1.5°C-compatible pathway are not geophysical, but rather reflect inertia in our political and technological systems. Both political and corporate leadership are needed to overcome this inertia, supported by increased societal recognition of the need for system-level and individual lifestyle changes. The available evidence does not yet indicate that the world has seriously committed to achieving the 1.5°C goal.},

	abstract = {Regions and localities may lose many species to extinction under rapid climate change and may gain other species that colonize from nearby warmer environments. Here, it is argued that warming-induced species losses will generally exceed gains and there will be more net declines than net increases in plant community richness. Declines in richness are especially likely in water-limited climates where intensifying aridity will increasingly exceed plant tolerances, but also in colder temperature-limited climates where steep climatic gradients are lacking, and therefore, large pools of appropriate species are not immediately adjacent. The selectivity of warming-induced losses may lead to declines in functional and phylogenetic diversity as well as in species richness, especially in water-limited climates. Our current understanding of climate-caused diversity trends may be overly influenced by numerous studies coming from north-temperate alpine mountaintops, where conditions are unusually favourable for increases—possibly temporary—in local species richness.

Detecting extrapolation into novel conditions is a critical step in evaluating bioclimatic projections of how species and ecosystems will respond to climate change. However, biologically informed novelty detection methods remain elusive for many modeling algorithms. To assist with bioclimatic model design and evaluation, we present a first-approximation assessment of general novelty based on a simple and consistent characterization of climate. We build on the seminal global analysis of Williams et al. (2007 PNAS, 104, 5738) by assessing of end-of-21st-century novelty for North America at high spatial resolution and by refining their standardized Euclidean distance into an intuitive Mahalanobian metric called sigma dissimilarity. Like this previous study, we found extensive novelty in end-of-21st-century projections for the warm southern margin of the continent as well as the western Arctic. In addition, we detected localized novelty in lower topographic positions at all latitudes: By the end of the 21st century, novel climates are projected to emerge at low elevations in 80\% and 99\% of ecoregions in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios, respectively. Novel climates are limited to 7\% of the continent's area in RCP4.5, but are much more extensive in RCP8.5 (40\% of area). These three risk factors for novel climates – regional susceptibility, topographic position, and the magnitude of projected climate change – represent a priori evaluation criteria for the credibility of bioclimatic projections. Our findings indicate that novel climates can emerge in any landscape. Interpreting climatic novelty in the context of nonlinear biological responses to climate is an important challenge for future research.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.},

	abstract = {Tree species are expected to track warming climate by shifting their ranges to higher latitudes or elevations, but current evidence of latitudinal range shifts for suites of species is largely indirect. In response to global warming, offspring of trees are predicted to have ranges extend beyond adults at leading edges and the opposite relationship at trailing edges. Large-scale forest inventory data provide an opportunity to compare present latitudes of seedlings and adult trees at their range limits. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we directly compared seedling and tree 5th and 95th percentile latitudes for 92 species in 30 longitudinal bands for 43 334 plots across the eastern United States. We further compared these latitudes with 20th century temperature and precipitation change and functional traits, including seed size and seed spread rate. Results suggest that 58.7\% of the tree species examined show the pattern expected for a population undergoing range contraction, rather than expansion, at both northern and southern boundaries. Fewer species show a pattern consistent with a northward shift (20.7\%) and fewer still with a southward shift (16.3\%). Only 4.3\% are consistent with expansion at both range limits. When compared with the 20th century climate changes that have occurred at the range boundaries themselves, there is no consistent evidence that population spread is greatest in areas where climate has changed most; nor are patterns related to seed size or dispersal characteristics. The fact that the majority of seedling extreme latitudes are less than those for adult trees may emphasize the lack of evidence for climate-mediated migration, and should increase concerns for the risks posed by climate change.},

However, long-term shifts in tree species ranges remain poorly documented. We test for shifts in the northern range limits of 16 temperate tree species in Quebec, Canada, using forest inventory data spanning three decades, 15° of longitude and 7° of latitude. Range shifts were correlated with climate warming and dispersal traits to understand potential mechanisms underlying changes. Shifts were calculated as the change in the 95th percentile of latitudinal occurrence between two inventory periods (1970-1978, 2000-2012) and for two life stages: saplings and adults. We also examined sapling and adult range offsets within each inventory, and changes in the offset through time. Tree species ranges shifted predominantly northward, although species responses varied. As expected shifts were greater for tree saplings, 0.34 km yr-1 , than for adults, 0.13 km yr-1 . Range limits were generally further north for adults compared to saplings, but the difference diminished through time, consistent with patterns observed for range shifts within each life stage. This suggests caution should be exercised when interpreting geographic range offsets between life stages as evidence of range shifts in the absence of temporal data. Species latitudinal velocities were on average {\textless}50\% of the velocity required to equal the spatial velocity of climate change and were mostly unrelated to dispersal traits. Finally, our results add to the body of evidence suggesting tree species are mostly limited in their capacity to track climate warming, supporting concerns that warming will negatively impact the functioning of forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of tree range dynamics has emerged as an important component of adaptive responses of forest management to global change scenarios such as extreme precipitation events and/or invasive species. Comparisons between the locations of adults versus seedlings of individual tree species using contemporary forest inventories is one tool widely used to assess the status of tree ranges in light of these changing conditions. With the consistent remeasurement of standard forest inventory plots across the entire eastern US occurring since the 2000s, the opportunity exists to evaluate the stability of tree ranges of focal species across a decade. Using said inventory, the northern range margins of tree distributions were examined by comparing differences (Holm-Sidak adjusted p-value = 0.2) in the 95th percentile locations of seedlings to adults (i.e., trees) by 0.5 degree longitudinal bands over nearly 10 years and by categories of canopy disturbance (i.e., canopy gap formation) for 20 study species. Our results suggest that range margins are stable for 85\% of study species at both time one and at remeasurement regardless of canopy disturbance. For the very few species that had a significant difference in seedlings and adults at their range margins, there was nearly a 0.4 degree difference in latitude with seedlings being farther south irrespective of disturbance. Our findings of tree range stability across forests of the eastern US indicate a general propensity towards range contraction, especially for study species forecasted to lose range and located on disturbed sites, which may present substantial hurdles for adaptive management strategies focused on maintaining and enhancing forest ecosystem resilience in the context of global change and associated rapid climate change.},

While its risks and benefits have been debated, and suggestions for planning and management given, there is little consensus within the academic literature over whether to adopt it as a policy. We evaluated the main features of the assisted migration literature including the study methods, taxonomic groups, geographic regions and disciplines involved. We further assessed the debate about the use of assisted migration, the main barriers to consensus, and the range of recommendations put forth in the literature for policy, planning or implementation. Commentaries and secondary literature reviews were as prevalent as first-hand scientific research and attention focussed on a global rather than regional level. There was little evidence of knowledge transfer outside of the natural sciences, despite the obvious policy relevance. Scholarly debate on this topic has intensified during the last 3years. We present a conceptual framework for evaluating arguments in the debate, distinguishing among the direct risks and benefits to species, ecosystems and society on the one hand, and other arguments regarding scientific justification, evidence-base and feasibility on the other. We also identify recommendations with potential to advance the debate, including careful evaluation of risks, benefits and trade-offs, involvement of relevant stakeholders and consideration of the complementarity among assisted migration and less risk-tolerant strategies. We conclude, however, that none of these will solve the fundamental, often values-based, challenges in the debate.

These pressures, collectively, demand land managers to reassess current and potential forest management practices. We discuss three considerations, functional restoration, assisted migration, and bioengineering, which are currently being debated in the literature and have the potential to be applied independently or concurrently across a variety of scales. The emphasis of functional restoration is to reestablish or maintain functions provided by the forest ecosystem, such as water quality, wildlife habitat, or carbon sequestration. Maintaining function may call upon actions such as assisted migration—moving tree populations within a species current range to aid adaptation to climate change or moving a species far outside its current range to avoid extinction—and we attempt to synthesize an array of assisted migration terminology. In addition, maintenance of species and the functions they provide may also require new technologies, such as genetic engineering, which, compared with traditional approaches to breeding for pest resistance, may be accomplished more rapidly to meet and overcome the challenges of invasive insect and disease pests. As managers develop holistic adaptive strategies to current and future anthropogenic stresses, functional restoration, assisted migration, and bioengineering, either separately or in combinations, deserve consideration, but must be addressed within the context of the restoration goal.},

	abstract = {There is increasing momentum to implement conservation and management approaches that adapt forests to climate change so as to sustain ecosystem functions. These range from actions designed to increase the resistance of current composition and structure to negative impacts to those designed to transition forests to substantially different characteristics. A component of many adaptation approaches will likely include assisted migration of future climate-adapted tree species or genotypes. While forest-assisted migration (FAM) has been discussed conceptually and examined experimentally for almost a decade, operationalizing FAM (i.e., routine use in forest conservation and management projects) lags behind the acceptance of the need for climate adaptation. As the vulnerability of forest ecosystems in climate change increases, FAM may need to become an integral management tool to reduce long-term risks to ecosystem function, despite real and perceived barriers for its implementation. Here we discuss the concept of operational-scale FAM and why it remains a controversial, not yet widely adopted component of climate adaptation. We present three case studies of operational-scale FAM to illustrate how the practice can be approached pragmatically within an adaptation framework despite the barriers to acceptance. Finally, we discuss a path toward advancing the wide use of operational-scale FAM.},

Assisted migration (AM) is the translocation of species or genotypes from their current ranges to areas predicted to have a supportive future climate. Although correlations of species ranges with climate are traditionally used to explore AM potential, successful AM strategies will have to consider many other variables. In this article, we review recent research that informs the complexity of AM decisions. Local microenvironment, herbivory, and intraspecific interactions frequently outweigh climate in determining species establishment and survival. Species adopt several strategies to cope with drought, heat, and cold, but translocated genetic material can display cryptic maladaptation when challenged by extreme, out-of-range weather events. Phenology, photoperiod, and climate are related in complex, often provenance-specific ways. We discuss the implications of our findings for forestry AM and make recommendations for incorporating these insights into future research and AM practice.},

	abstract = {Considerable uncertainties remain about magnitude and character, if not general direction of anthropogenic climate change. Global mean temperature could increase by 1.5–4.5°C or more over historic levels, and extreme weather events—drought, storms, and flooding—are likely to increase greatly in frequency. Although ecologists and foresters agree that the practice of forestry will be transformed under climate change, these uncertainties compound the challenge of achieving sustainable, adaptive forest management. In this aritcle, we (i) present a multidisciplinary synthesis of current knowledge of responses of temperate and boreal tree species and forest communities to climate change, and (ii) outline silvicultural strategies for adapting temperate and boreal forests to confront climate change. Our knowledge synthesis proceeds through critical appraisals of efforts to model future tree distributions and responses to climate change, and reviews physiological, phenological, acclimation, and epigenetic responses to climate. As is the case of climate change itself, there are numerous uncertainties about tree species and provenance responses to climate change. For example, acclimation of respiration and epigenetic conditioning of seed embryos has the potential to buffer species against limited warming. Provenances within species also display idiosyncratic responses to altered climates, implying that soemm varieties will be more resilient or resistant to climate change than others. Genetically determined limits to climatic tolerance, and the limits of tree community resistance and resilience (speed of recovery from disturbance) in the face of climate-related disturbances are largely unknown. These unknowns require managers to adopt a portfolio of silvicultural strategies, which may range from minor modifications of current practices to design of novel multi-species stands that may have no historical analogue. Forest managers must be prepared to respond nimbly as they develop, incorporate new insights about climate change and species responses to warming into their practices. Marshalling all strategies and sources of knowledge should enable forest managers to mount (at least) a partially successful response to the challenges of climate change.},

We used difference maps to directly compare downscaled projections of temperature and precipitation across North America for two versions (or generations) of three different Atmospheric-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCM)s. We found that AOGCM versions differed in their projections for the end of the current century by up to 4 °C for annual mean temperature and 60\% for annual precipitation. To place these changes in an ecological context, we reanalyzed our work on shifts in tree climate envelopes (CEs) using the newer-generation AOGCM projections. Based on the updated AOGCMs, by the 2071–2100 period, tree CEs shifted up to 2.4 degrees further north or 2.6 degrees further south (depending on the AOGCM) and were about 10\% larger in size. Despite considerable differences between versions of a given AOGCM, projections made by the newer version of each AOGCM were in general agreement, suggesting convergence across the three models studied here. Assessing the AOGCM outputs in this way provides insight into the magnitude and importance of change associated with AOGCM upgrades as they continue to evolve through time.},

This carbon sink seems to be in decline, however, as a result of factors such as deforestation and climate change1–3. Here we investigate Amazonia’s carbon budget and the main drivers responsible for its change into a carbon source. We performed 590 aircraft vertical profiling measurements of lower-tropospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide at four sites in Amazonia from 2010 to 20184. We find that total carbon emissions are greater in eastern Amazonia than in the western part, mostly as a result of spatial differences in carbon-monoxide-derived fire emissions. Southeastern Amazonia, in particular, acts as a net carbon source (total carbon flux minus fire emissions) to the atmosphere. Over the past 40 years, eastern Amazonia has been subjected to more deforestation, warming and moisture stress than the western part, especially during the dry season, with the southeast experiencing the strongest trends5–9. We explore the effect of climate change and deforestation trends on carbon emissions at our study sites, and find that the intensification of the dry season and an increase in deforestation seem to promote ecosystem stress, increase in fire occurrence, and higher carbon emissions in the eastern Amazon. This is in line with recent studies that indicate an increase in tree mortality and a reduction in photosynthesis as a result of climatic changes across Amazonia1,10.},

Quantifying forest vulnerability to disturbances and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, observational evidence is largely missing at regional to continental scales. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of European forests to fires, windthrows and insect outbreaks during the period 1979–2018 by integrating machine learning with disturbance data and satellite products. We show that about 33.4 billion tonnes of forest biomass could be seriously affected by these disturbances, with higher relative losses when exposed to windthrows (40\%) and fires (34\%) compared to insect outbreaks (26\%). The spatial pattern in vulnerability is strongly controlled by the interplay between forest characteristics and background climate. Hotspot regions for vulnerability are located at the borders of the climate envelope, in both southern and northern Europe. There is a clear trend in overall forest vulnerability that is driven by a warming-induced reduction in plant defence mechanisms to insect outbreaks, especially at high latitudes.},

This is reflected in unexpected disturbance events, as well as new and increasing socio-economic demands, all of which are affecting the resilience of forest ecosystems worldwide and the provision of important ecosystem services. This Anthropocene era is forcing us to reconsider past and current forest management and silvicultural practices, and search for new ones that are more flexible and better at dealing with the increasing uncertainty brought about by these accelerating and cumulative global changes. Here, we briefly review the focus and limitations of past and current forest management and silvicultural practices mainly as developed in Europe and North America. We then discuss some recent promising concepts, such as managing forests as complex adaptive systems, and approaches based on resilience, functional diversity, assisted migration and multi-species plantations, to propose a novel approach to integrate the functionality of species-traits into a functional complex network approach as a flexible and multi-scale way to manage forests for the Anthropocene. This approach takes into consideration the high level of uncertainty associated with future environmental and societal changes. It relies on the quantification and dynamic monitoring of functional diversity and complex network indices to manage forests as a functional complex network. Using this novel approach, the most efficient forest management and silvicultural practices can be determined, as well as where, at what scale, and at what intensity landscape-scale resistance, resilience and adaptive capacity of forests to global changes can be improved.},

	abstract = {Land use policies have turned southern China into one of the most intensively managed forest regions in the world, with actions maximizing forest cover on soils with marginal agricultural potential while concurrently increasing livelihoods and mitigating climate change. Based on satellite observations, here we show that diverse land use changes in southern China have increased standing aboveground carbon stocks by 0.11 ± 0.05 Pg C y−1 during 2002–2017. Most of this regional carbon sink was contributed by newly established forests (32\%), while forests already existing contributed 24\%. Forest growth in harvested forest areas contributed 16\% and non-forest areas contributed 28\% to the carbon sink, while timber harvest was tripled. Soil moisture declined significantly in 8\% of the area. We demonstrate that land management in southern China has been removing an amount of carbon equivalent to 33\% of regional fossil CO2 emissions during the last 6 years, but forest growth saturation, land competition for food production and soil-water depletion challenge the longevity of this carbon sink service.},

	abstract = {Clear-cutting is a controversial practice that is widely applied in forests managed for wood production in many parts of the world. This paper aims to provide an objective synthesis of the ecological effects of clear-cutting as a basis for more informed discussion of its merits and disadvantages. A definition of clear-cutting is put forward, and its place in modern productive forestry is described. Effects on microclimate, water, soil, nutrient cycling, and the diversity and composition of plant and animal species are reviewed. The effects of clear-cutting vary considerably depending on site conditions (such as climate, geology, and topography) and on the structure and composition of the forest, the extent and distribution of harvesting, the method used to extract the logs, and the length of time before the forest is removed again. However, it is evident that many of the ecological impacts commonly ascribed to clear-cutting, in fact, result from other stages of the wood-production process, such as the quality and intensity of roading, site preparation practices (such as mechanical disturbance or slash burning), and the intensity of control of noncrop vegetation. Situations where clear-cutting is inappropriate are described. It is argued that in the right situations, with appropriate safeguards, it is an environmentally sound practice that offers many advantages in terms of the production of wood fibre.Key words: clear-cutting, environmental impacts, microclimate, hydrology, soil, forest production, nutrient cycling, wildlife.},

	abstract = {A secondary succession sequence of 14 northern hardwoods stands was sampled for forest floor organic matter and nutrient content. During the first 15 yr following clear cutting, the forest floor decreased by 30.7 Mg/ha, a decline of over 50\%. The decrease in the forest floor and slash (logging residue) may be greater than the increase in the living biomass. During the next 50 yr the forest floor increased by 28.0 Mg/ha and by year 64 was within 5\% of an asymptote of 56.0 Mg/ha. Nutrients were analyzed in 6 of the 14 stands. Magnesium, potassium, and nitrogen concentrations showed no successional pattern. However, calcium concentrations were significantly higher in the stands in which forest floor mass was low. The initial decrease in forest floor mass is attributed to lower leaf and wood litter fall and to more rapid decay resulting from higher temperature, moisture content, and nutrient levels and to early successional litter being more easily decomposed. The recovery of the forest floor is explained primarily as resulting from the rapid increase in the quantity and diameter of wood litter fall. JABOWA, the northern hardwood forest growth simulator, predicts a maximum rate of increase in woody litter by years 10-20 with a leveling off by years 30-50. An apparent asynchrony in function of the forest floor and slash as nutrient sources may be important to the recovery process. During the first 15 yr the forest floor is a major source of nutrients, releasing a net amount of approximately 800 kg/ha of nitrogen. During this period nitrogen immobilization in the decay of slash may account for as much as one-half of the nitrogen released from the forest floor. After year 15 the forest floor is no longer a source but a sink for nutrients as nutrients and organic matter accumulate. By year 15 the slash probably shifts in function from a sink to a source, providing nitrogen for the continuing rapid nitrogen accumulation in vegetation beyond year 15.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Several studies have demonstrated the negative effects of clearcutting on terrestrial plethodontid salamander populations. However, none has experimentally compared clearcutting with multiple alternative timber-harvest methods. Using a randomized, replicated design, we compared the short-term effects ( 1–4 years after harvest ) of clearcutting to effects of leavetree, group selection, and two shelterwood cuts on terrestrial salamanders in the southern Appalachian Mountains of Virginia and West Virginia ( U.S.A. ). Treatment plots were 2 ha each. We also compared salamander age class ( percent juvenile ), fecundity ( percentage of females carrying eggs and average number of eggs per gravid female ), size of gravid females, and species composition and diversity between treatments with canopy removal ( cut ) and those without canopy removal ( uncut ). All treatments with canopy removal had significantly fewer salamanders than the control treatment, but salamander abundances on alternative treatments with canopy removal did not differ significantly from salamander abundances on the clearcuts. There were no significant differences between cut and uncut treatments in the proportion of females that were gravid or in the average number of eggs in gravid females; however, gravid Plethodon cinereus females weighed more on the cut treatments and gravid Desmognathus ochrophaeus females weighed more on uncut treatments. There were no significant differences between cut and uncut treatments in the proportion of the sample that was juvenile, except in the largest species tested, P. glutinosus, which had a significantly higher proportion of juveniles in the uncut treatments. We conclude that initial declines in terrestrial plethodontid abundance caused by timber harvesting may be minimized across the landscape by concentrating high-intensity timber harvesting ( clearcutting ) in small areas ( a few hectares in size ).},

We used pitfall traps to sample 4 previously harvested 45-60-year-old forested areas and 4 adjacent areas clearcut 2-5 years previously. In a separate experiment, we conducted surveys before and after thinning on 4 control and 4 treatment sites. Western red-backed salamanders (Plethodon vehiculum), ensatinas (Ensatina eschscholtzii), northwestern salamanders (Ambystoma gracile), rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa), and Dunn's salamanders (Plethodon dunni) were captured in both forested and clearcut areas. Columbia torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton kezeri) and Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) were captured only in forested areas. Capture rates of red-backed salamanders were greater in forested than clearcut areas in fall 1994 and 1995). The size-class distribution of red-backed salamanders was skewed toward the smaller size classes in clearcut areas in fall 1994 but not fall 1995. Ensatina showed no difference in capture rate or size-class distribution between forested and clearcut areas in fall 1994, but showed a reduced rate of capture in clearcut areas relative to forested areas in fall 1995. Gravid females were present in both clearcut and forested areas for western red-backed salamanders and ensatinas. Although species presence was unaffected by thinning, western red-backed salamander capture rates on treatment sites were reduced after thinning. Population responses of salamander species to forest management are variable, with some species declining in abundance after clearcutting and thinning.},

However, the reaction of soil fauna to forest harvesting differed significantly among the taxonomic groups, with negative, neutral, and positive effects observed. We found that the negative effect of forest harvesting on soil fauna increased with decreasing body size. In addition, the type of forest and harvesting practice played important roles in driving the responses of soil biota to forest harvesting. The abundance of Nematoda, Oribatida, and Enchytraeidae recovered to control values occurring approximately 10 years after harvesting. Despite the limitations of the dataset, the results obtained from our meta-analysis expand our understanding of the reaction of soil fauna to forest harvesting.},

We reviewed 287 published studies containing 1008 comparisons of species richness in managed and unmanaged forests and derived management, taxon and continent specific effect sizes. We show that in terms of local species richness loss, forest management types can be ranked, from best to worse, as follows: selection and retention systems, reduced impact logging, conventional selective logging, clear-cutting, agroforestry, timber plantations, fuelwood plantations. Next, we calculated the economic profitability in terms of the net present value of timber harvesting from 10 hypothetical wood-producing Forest Management Units (FMU) from around the globe. The ranking of management types is altered when the species loss per unit profit generated from the FMU is considered. This is due to differences in yield, timber species prices, rotation cycle length and production costs. We thus conclude that it would be erroneous to dismiss or prioritize timber production regimes, based solely on their ranking of alpha diversity impacts.},

Changes in forest structure, composition, and dynamics inevitably lead to changes in the biodiversity of forest-dwelling species. However, the possible biodiversity gains and losses due to forest management (i.e. anthropogenic pressures related to direct forest resource use) have never been assessed at a pan-European scale. We used meta-analysis to review 49 published papers containing 120 individual comparisons of species richness between unmanaged and managed forests throughout Europe. We explored the response of different taxonomic groups and the variability of their response with respect to time since abandonment and intensity of forest management. Species richness was slightly higher in unmanaged than in managed forests. Species dependent on forest cover continuity, deadwood, and large trees (bryophytes, lichens, fungi, saproxylic beetles) and carabids were negatively affected by forest management. In contrast, vascular plant species were favored. The response for birds was heterogeneous and probably depended more on factors such as landscape patterns. The global difference in species richness between unmanaged and managed forests increased with time since abandonment and indicated a gradual recovery of biodiversity. Clear-cut forests with tree species composition change had the strongest effect on species richness, but the effects of different types of management on taxa could not be assessed in a robust way because of low numbers of replications in the management-intensity classes. Our results show that some taxa are more affected by forestry than others, but there is a need for research into poorly studied species groups in Europe and in particular locations. Our meta-analysis supports the need for a coordinated European research network to study and monitor the biodiversity of different taxa in managed and unmanaged forests.},

If residual forest aggregates are to serve as temporary refugia for species sensitive to disturbance or environmental stress, microclimatic conditions must be sufficiently buffered to allow for their persistence. In 1-ha aggregates at three experimental sites in western Washington, we quantified spatial gradients in microclimate (light, air and soil temperature, and soil moisture), effects of aspect on these gradients, and how microclimate compared to conditions in adjacent harvest areas and larger tracts of undisturbed forest (controls). Light availability and temperature were greatest at the edge, but declined sharply inside the aggregate, with most change occurring within 20m of the edge. Beyond this distance, light generally declined to levels observed in the controls. Soil temperatures exhibited greater spatial variation and stabilized further from the edge (10–30m), but air temperatures were generally higher than those in controls. Soil moisture exhibited no spatial trends and was comparable among aggregates, harvest areas, and controls. Aspect exerted strong effects on light and temperature, particularly within 15m of the edge, as did forest structure. Where tree density was low, microclimatic gradients were less steep and aspect-related differences were small. Comparisons with previous studies of ground vegetation indicate that microclimatic effects were consistent, in part, with declines among some groups of vascular and non-vascular plants; however, these declines were restricted to edge environments (5–10m) and were unaffected by aspect. Our results suggest that 1-ha aggregates are sufficiently large to contain areas with light, temperature, and soil moisture that are comparable to those in undisturbed forest and suitable, in the short-term, for persistence of forest-dependent species.},

The objectives of this study were to determine the influence of (i) partial cutting (dispersed green-tree retention) and clear-cutting on air and soil temperatures and soil moisture, on surface mineral soil net ammonification, nitrification, and total N mineralization rates, and on soil microbial biomass and (ii) the proximity to trees in the green-tree retention areas on these factors. The study was conducted in 60- to 70-year-old stands in the Cedar River Watershed, about 70 km southeast of Seattle, Wash., between July 1994 and August 1995. Air and soil temperatures and soil moisture in the green-tree retention treatments were generally intermediate between the uncut forest and the clearcut treatments. There were no significant differences in net ammonification, nitrification, and total N mineralization rates and in soil microbial biomass among treatments. Soil moisture influenced net ammonification and total N mineralization rates and microbial biomass. Nitrogen dynamics were generally not influenced by nearness to trees in the green-tree retention treatment. Average microbial biomass, however, was higher near to green trees (1 m) than far (6 m).},

	abstract = {As compared to natural forests, managed boreal forests are younger, more homogeneous in terms of tree age and species composition, and consist of smaller fragments. Here we examine the effects of such characteristics caused by forestry on carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in the boreal region. The main results are the following. (1) Fragmentation of forests and the size of a fragment appear not to be crucial for the survival of the majority of forest carabids, as they tend to be distributed over various successional stages, but species requiring old-growth habitats suffer. (2) For carabids there appear to be no or very few edge specialist species, and forest-open land edges appear to be effective barriers for species associated with forest or open habitat. However, generalist species easily cross the edge, and edges of forest fragments may be invaded by species from the surrounding open habitat. (3) Habitat change following clear-cutting dramatically changes the composition of carabid assemblages: species restricted to mature forests disappear and open-habitat species invade, while habitat generalists survive at least in the short term. Carabid diversity can probably best be maintained if forest management mimics natural processes, maintains natural structures and includes the natural composition of vegetation and other structural elements (such as dead wood) within the stands, provided that these forest features can be maintained and recreated through forest management practices. At a larger scale, the whole spectrum of forest types and ages (especially old-growth forests), and different successional processes (especially fire) should be maintained. These require the development and use of innovative logging methods, and the planning, implementation, and assessment of landscape-scale ecological management strategies.},

	abstract = {Staphylinid beetle assemblages from coniferous foothills forest in west-central Alberta, Canada were studied via pitfall trapping to examine the effects of stand age and possible edge effects. Sites included a chronosequence of stands from 1 to 27 years post-harvest, and four types of mature forest that had not been disturbed by fire for at least 80 years. In all, 19 sites were sampled between 1989 and 1991. A total of 98 species were identified, nine of which are reported for the first time in Alberta. Staphylinids were more abundant in mature forest stands but assemblages were more diverse in regenerating stands. Thirty-four rove beetle species showed significant indicator value for particular stands or groups of stands, including mature forest, young forest, and open ground specialists. After harvesting, the catch rate of many forest species decreased dramatically, and open ground species were more commonly collected. Populations of some forest species remained active on logged sites for one or 2 years before disappearing. As stands regenerated, they were colonized by species characteristic of young stands, but true forest species were found only in older unharvested stands. The beetle assemblages from regenerating stands became more similar to those from mature stands as they aged, but still differed considerably from them 27 years after harvesting. Transects across forest-clearcut edges revealed a significant beetle response to habitat edges. Staphylinids assemblages were compared to the ground beetle (Carabidae) assemblage sampled via the same pitfall trapping regime. Mature forest specialists are threatened by fragmentation and loss of habitat. In order to conserve these beetle assemblages, forest managers should retain adequate patches of older successional stages on working landscapes.},

	abstract = {Over 80\% of amphibian species that are declining are forest dependent. Forestry practices are a major cause of forest alterations globally, and it is well documented that clearcutting can contribute to amphibian declines. However, there might be adverse effects of forestry practices other than clearcutting. For example, planting overstory trees in rows (plantations) can change groundcover microhabitats and soil moisture levels, but the effects of this common practice on amphibian populations are not well studied. We compared the impacts of common intensive pine plantation operations to naturally regenerated pine forests on the desiccation, movement rates, behavior, and survival of {\textgreater}900 juvenile southern toads (Anaxyrus terrestris). Pine plantations had significantly more accumulation of conifer needles and less exposed soil, herbaceous groundcover, broadleaf litter, and soil moisture than natural pine forests despite the greater canopy cover at plantations. Litter cover explained 85\% of groundcover microhabitat variance among forest types and predicted minimum soil moisture levels. When toads were held in small outdoor enclosures that constrained microhabitat selection, 24-h desiccation rates and 72-h mortality were significantly greater in pine plantation than in naturally regenerated pine forest because of lower soil moisture, especially during low rainfall periods. In large outdoor pens where juvenile amphibians could select microhabitats, movement was strongly directed down slope and increased with precipitation. However, initial speeds were positively associated with pine density, likely because toads were trying to evacuate from the drier high-pine-density areas. High-intensity silviculture practices that eliminate herbaceous or vegetative groundcover, such as roller chopping and scalping, increase amphibian desiccation because planted conifers dry the upper soil layer. Our study highlights the importance of prioritizing lower intensity silviculture practices or lower pine densities to retain groundcover microhabitat that serves as amphibian refugia from dry conditions that are predicted to increase in frequency with climate change.},

We then review indicator potentials of arthropod groups to explore the ecological consequences of forest management practices. Different arthropod groups respond differently to forest management. Ants, carabid beetles, and spiders often respond to local-scale, disturbance-induced vegetation development caused by thinning and can be used to infer the ecological suitability of forest management treatments. Dung beetles and moths respond to habitat alterations caused by forest fragmentation and can indicate the suitability of landscape-level forest management techniques. Butterflies and cerambycid beetles respond highly positively to the presence of herbaceous plants and understory trees and can be used to infer the integrity of thinning treatments in forest management. Syrphid flies, which are strong flyers associated with vegetation complexity, can be used as bioindicators of landscape-level forest management practices. Monitoring regulatory service providers may also help when designing forest management practices. We propose using arthropod bioindicator groups to effectively design and assess ecologically sustainable management plans for both natural and plantation forests.},

	abstract = {The high functional and unmatched biological diversity represented by arthropods demand that these organisms be considered as ecological indicators of sustainable forest management. Successful use of arthropods in this capacity will require a systematic and rigorous process, including selection of potential indicators, definition of relationships between indicators and disturbance variables, optimization of the useful range of the indicator and application of the indicator(s) in monitoring. In Canada, the single greatest impediment to the use of arthropods as ecological indicators is the importance of accurate species-level identification and the difficulty achieving it. Consequently, most work has focused on a few relatively well-known groups (e.g., epigaeic carabid and staphylinid beetles and spiders, saproxylic beetles, butterflies and larger night flying moths).Many recent studies have provided baseline data about the range of natural variation and have begun to quantify arthropod responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the context of preplanned experiments or through various retrospective approaches. Carabid beetles are the best-studied group and sufficient sets of data now exist to permit a meta-analysis of the robustness of carabids as indicators across multiple spatial scales and in terms of how well they represent broader ecological responses to disturbances. There is good potential to incorporate arthropod indicators into monitoring programs in Canada, but it is necessary to first complete a scientifically credible selection process for specific ecological indicators. Future research should focus on completing the process for taxa under current study as this develops the best presently understood opportunities for using arthropod indicators in assessing various aspects of environmental change. Researchers should also consider other means of monitoring arthropod biodiversity by the use of surrogate ecological parameters such as ecological land classification and habitat classification systems.

Here we show that a recent mass extinction associated with pathogen outbreaks is tied to global warming. Seventeen years ago, in the mountains of Costa Rica, the Monteverde harlequin frog (Atelopus sp.) vanished along with the golden toad (Bufo periglenes). An estimated 67\% of the 110 or so species of Atelopus, which are endemic to the American tropics, have met the same fate, and a pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) is implicated. Analysing the timing of losses in relation to changes in sea surface and air temperatures, we conclude with ‘very high confidence’ ({\textgreater} 99\%, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) that large-scale warming is a key factor in the disappearances. We propose that temperatures at many highland localities are shifting towards the growth optimum of Batrachochytrium, thus encouraging outbreaks. With climate change promoting infectious disease and eroding biodiversity, the urgency of reducing greenhouse-gas concentrations is now undeniable.},

Lungless, woodland salamanders depend on forested habitats and are sensitive to changes in temperature and moisture associated with many forestry practices. Additionally, woodland salamanders are territorial and have relatively low vagility, making it unlikely that they can successfully migrate to more favorable habitat when the surrounding forest is harvested. Therefore, we examined the abundance of the Western Slimy Salamander, Plethodon albagula, in an experimentally manipulated forest in central Missouri. We used artificial cover object searches to compare salamander abundance in three replicate treatments that were clear-cut then burned to reduce maple regeneration, clear-cut and not burned, partially harvested, and un-manipulated control forest. We captured a total of 300 Western Slimy Salamanders between April 2007 and September 2011. We found significantly fewer salamanders in the burn and clear-cut treatments compared with the partial and control treatments. We also found a lower proportion of juveniles and had fewer recaptures in the burn and clear-cut than in the partial and control treatments. Consistent with other studies of woodland salamanders, our results suggest that for at least the first 7years post-harvest, clear-cutting is detrimental to woodland salamander populations. This initial reduction in abundance combined with the further reduced proportion of juveniles may have longer lasting effects even as the forest regenerates. Finally, it appears that timber harvest resulting in limited canopy thinning may be compatible with maintaining populations of Western Slimy Salamanders in Missouri.},

	abstract = {Climate change, with warming temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns, may increase natural-caused forest fire activity. Increasing natural-caused fires throughout western United States national forests could place people, property, and infrastructure at risk in the future. We used the fine K nearest neighbor (KNN) method coupled with the downscaled Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) climate dataset to estimate changes in the rate of natural-caused fires in western United States national forests. We projected changes in the rate of minor and major forest fires from historical (1986-2015) to future (2070-2099) conditions to characterize fire-prone national forests under a range of climate change scenarios. The results indicate that climate change can add to the occurrence of forest fires in western United States national forests, particularly in Rocky Mountain, Pacific Southwest, and Southwestern United States Forest Service regions. Although summer months are projected to have the highest rate of natural-caused forest fire activity in the future, the rate of natural-caused forest fires is likely to increase from August to December in the future compared to the historical conditions. Improved understanding of altered forest fire regimes can help forest managers to better understand the potential effects of climate change on future fire activity and implement actions to attenuate possible negative consequences.},

This introductory paper for the special issue of The Forestry Chronicle on the subject of assisted migration describes increasing interest in the subject and its complexity It also provides an overview of the potential scale of assisted migration, proposes a terminology, and briefly introduces the following papers. Overall, the five papers aim to present a comprehensive state of the scientific and operational knowledge and the debate on assisted migration in the context of Canada's forests.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10531-013-0458-8},
	abstract = {Nearly 4 \% of the world’s forests are plantations, established to provide a variety of ecosystem services, principally timber and other wood products. In addition to such services, plantation forests provide direct and indirect benefits to biodiversity via the provision of forest habitat for a wide range of species, and by reducing negative impacts on natural forests by offsetting the need to extract resources. There is compelling evidence that climate change is directly affecting biodiversity in forests throughout the world. These impacts occur as a result of changes in temperature, rainfall, storm frequency and magnitude, fire frequency, and the frequency and magnitude of pest and disease outbreaks. However, in plantation forests it is not only the direct effects of climate change that will impact on biodiversity. Climate change will have strong indirect effects on biodiversity in plantation forests via changes in forest management actions that have been proposed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the productive capacity of plantations. These include changes in species selection (including use of species mixtures), rotation length, thinning, pruning, extraction of bioenergy feedstocks, and large scale climate change driven afforestation, reforestation, and, potentially deforestation. By bringing together the potential direct and indirect impacts of climate change we conclude that in the short to medium term changes in plantation management designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change could have a significantly greater impact on biodiversity in such plantation forests than the direct effects of climate change. Although this hypothesis remains to be formally tested, forest managers worldwide are already considering new approaches to plantation forestry in an effort to create forests that are more resilient to the effects of changing climatic conditions. Such change presents significant risks to existing biodiversity values in plantation forests, however it also provides new opportunities to improve biodiversity values within existing and new plantation forests. We conclude by suggesting future options, such as functional zoning and species mixtures applied at either the stand level or as fine-scale mosaics of single-species stands as options to improve biodiversity whilst increasing resilience to climate change.},

	abstract = {A number of previous modeling studies have assessed the implications of projected CO2-induced climate change for future terrestrial ecosystems. However, although current understanding of possible long-term response of vegetation to elevated CO2 and CO2-induced climate change in some geographical areas (e.g., the high-latitude regions) has been strengthened by dint of accumulating evidence from these past studies, it is still weak in others. This study examines the responses of global potential natural vegetation distribution, net primary production (NPP), and fire emissions to future changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Land Model's dynamic global vegetation model. The model is run to vegetative equilibrium (i.e., with respect to leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation coverage) driven with preindustrial climate and future climate near 2100, respectively, simulated by eight general circulation models (GCMs). The simulated potential vegetation under the preindustrial control mean climate (CO2 concentration held at 275 ppm) is compared with that under the SRESA1B 2100 mean climate (CO2 concentration stabilizes at 720 ppm beyond 2100). Simulated vegetation response ranges from mild changes of the fractional coverage of different plant functional types to the rather dramatic changes of dominant plant functional types. Although such response differs significantly across different GCM climate projections, a quite consistent spatial pattern emerges, characterized by a considerable poleward spread or shift of temperate and boreal forests in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, and a substantial degradation of vegetation type in the tropics (e.g., increase of drought deciduous trees coverage at the expense of evergreen trees) especially in portions of West and southern Africa and South America. Despite the widespread degradation of vegetation type in the tropics, NPP, and growing season LAI are predicted to increase under most GCM scenarios over most of the globe. Carbon fluxes to the atmosphere due to fire generally increase too across the globe. Such responses of NPP and fire occurrence result from the synergistic effects of CO2 concentration changes, climate changes, and vegetation changes. In the HadCM-driven simulation, however, extreme responses are shown in some regions: Deciduous forest is replaced by grasses in large areas in the middle latitudes, and substantial areas in northern South America and southern Africa predominantly covered by evergreen forest are replaced with grasses while NPP and fire emissions reduce drastically (by more than 100\%). A future paper will examine how the biosphere response documented here influences the impact of climate change on surface hydrological conditions.},

	abstract = {Despite the numerous studies which have been conducted during the past decade on species ranges and their relationship to the environment, our understanding of how environmental conditions shape species distribution is still far from complete. Yet, some process-based species distribution models have been able to simulate plants and insects distribution at a global scale. These models strongly rely on the completion of the annual cycle of the species and therefore on their accomplished phenology. In particular, they have shown that the northern limit of species' ranges appears to be caused mainly by the inability to undergo full fruit maturation, while the southern limit appears to be caused by the inability to flower or unfold leaves owing to a lack of chilling temperatures that are necessary to break bud dormancy. I discuss here why phenology is a key adaptive trait in shaping species distribution using mostly examples from plant species, which have been the most documented. After discussing how phenology is involved in fitness and why it is an adaptive trait susceptible to evolve quickly in changing climate conditions, I describe how phenology is related to fitness in species distribution process-based models and discuss the fate of species under climate change scenarios using model projections and experimental or field studies from the literature.},

	abstract = {New analyses are presented addressing the global impacts of recent climate change on phenology of plant and animal species. A meta-analysis spanning 203 species was conducted on published datasets from the northern hemisphere. Phenological response was examined with respect to two factors: distribution of species across latitudes and taxonomic affiliation or functional grouping of target species. Amphibians had a significantly stronger shift toward earlier breeding than all other taxonomic/functional groups, advancing more than twice as fast as trees, birds and butterflies. In turn, butterfly emergence or migratory arrival showed three times stronger advancement than the first flowering of herbs, perhaps portending increasing asynchrony in insect–plant interactions. Response was significantly stronger at higher latitudes where warming has been stronger, but latitude explained {\textless} 4\% of the variation. Despite expectation, latitude was not yet an important predictor of climate change impacts on phenology. The only two previously published estimates of the magnitude of global response are quite different: 2.3 and 5.1daysdecade−1 advancement. The scientific community has assumed this difference to be real and has attempted to explain it in terms of biologically relevant phenomena: specifically, differences in distribution of data across latitudes, taxa or time periods. Here, these and other possibilities are explored. All analyses indicate that the difference in estimated response is primarily due to differences between the studies in criteria for incorporating data. It is a clear and automatic consequence of the exclusion by one study of data on ‘stable’ (nonresponsive) species. Once this is accounted for, the two studies support each other, generating similar conclusions despite analyzing substantially nonoverlapping datasets. Analyses here on a new expanded dataset estimate an overall spring advancement across the northern hemisphere of 2.8daysdecade−1. This is the first quantitative analysis showing that data-sampling methodologies significantly impact global (synthetic) estimates of magnitude of global warming response.},

	abstract = {Recent climatic trends and climate model projections indicate that climate change will modify rangeland ecosystem functions and the services and livelihoods that they provision. Recent history has demonstrated that climatic variability has a strong influence on both ecological and social components of rangeland systems and that these systems possess substantial capacity to adapt to climatic variability. Specific objectives of this synthesis are to: 1) evaluate options to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and future climate change; 2) survey actions that individuals, enterprises, and social organizations can use to adapt to climate change; and 3) assess options for system transformation when adaptation is no longer sufficient to contend with climate change. Mitigation for carbon sequestration does not appear economically viable, given the small and highly variable carbon dioxide fluxes of rangeland ecosystems and the high transaction costs that would be incurred. In contrast, adaptation strategies are numerous and provide a means to manage risks associated with climate change. Adaptation strategies are diverse, including altered risk perception by individuals, greater flexibility of production enterprises, and modifications to social organizations that emphasize climatic variability, rather than consistency. Many adaptations represent “no regrets” actions because their implementation can be justified without emphasis on pending climate change. Adaptations specific to livestock production systems can include flexible herd management, alternative livestock breeds or species, innovative pest management, modified enterprise structures, and geographic relocation. Social-ecological systems in which adaptation is insufficient to counter the adverse consequences of climate change might undergo transformative change to produce alternative ecosystem services, production enterprises, and livelihoods. The rangeland profession is in a pivotal position to provide leadership on this global challenge because it represents the intersection of management and scientific knowledge, includes diverse stakeholders who derive their livelihoods from rangelands, and interacts with organizations responsible for rangeland stewardship.},

Partial harvest methods have been used extensively in temperate broadleaf and mixedwood ecosystems to promote regeneration on poorly stocked sites and to maintain forest composition and productivity. However, their effectiveness in promoting conifer establishment has yet to be demonstrated in unmanaged boreal forests, especially those dominated by black spruce ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Picea mariana{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (Mill.) BSP) where constraints for regeneration differ from those found in more meridional regions. We aimed to evaluate conifer seedling density and dimensions, 10 years after the onset of a gradient of silvicultural treatments varying in harvesting intensities, and to identify the critical factors driving the regeneration process. Study blocks of even-aged black spruce stands in the eastern Canadian boreal forest were submitted to three variants of shelterwood harvesting: a seed-tree harvest, a clear-cut and an untreated control. Shelterwood and seed-tree harvesting were combined with spot scarification to promote regeneration. Shelterwood and seed-tree harvesting produced a density of conifer regeneration sufficient to maintain forest productivity, but they did not promote seedling growth. Black spruce was the predominant species in terms of regeneration density, with proportions 3–5× higher than that for balsam fir ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Abies balsamea{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (L.) Mill.). Ten years after treatment, seed-origin black spruce seedlings were abundant in skidding trails, while layers dominated the residual strips. Balsam fir density was not influenced by treatment nor by tree position relative to skidding trails. Balsam fir and black spruce had different responses to treatment in terms of height and diameter, the former exhibiting a better growth performance and larger diameter in the residual strips. Spot scarification created micro-sites that had a significant impact on the regeneration process. Overall, our results support that shelterwood and seed-tree harvesting combined with scarification enable adequate regeneration in black spruce stands, confirming these treatments as viable silvicultural alternatives to clear-cutting when required by sustainable forest management objectives.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Light, vegetation, and regeneration dynamics were monitored for 11 years as part of a partial harvesting experiment in an aspen-dominated boreal mixedwood stand in northeastern Ontario. The partial cut treatment removed 43\% of the original basal area in the overstory. An outbreak of forest tent caterpillar between years 3 and 5 further reduced the original overstory (about 22\%, mainly aspen) in the partial cut and uncut treatments. Clearcutting enhanced the density of hardwood regeneration but reduced the amount of conifer regeneration compared with the partial cut and uncut treatments. Reducing the overstory canopy increased the height growth of hardwood regeneration, density of speckled alder—the dominant tall shrub on site, and understory light levels but did not change the mean heights of conifer regeneration and shrubs. Harvesting generally did not affect the amounts of low understory vegetation, except mosses, which decreased significantly in cover in the clearcut. Although most of the conifer regeneration was still under hardwood regeneration and shrub layers, much of the advance conifer regeneration had reached over 4.0m (large sapling) between years 5 and 11 in both partial cut and uncut treatments. From years 5 to 11, the residual overstory inhibited hardwood regeneration and understory shrubs even more, reducing density, height, and number of hardwood in-growth into large saplings. The dynamics of regeneration and understory vegetation that we observed during the 11 years following harvesting, compounded by a forest tent caterpillar infestation, suggest that partial harvesting can promote the establishment and growth of shade-tolerant conifers (mainly balsam fir and some black spruce) and inhibit the development of shade-intolerant hardwood regeneration and understory vegetation. Future stand structure will likely consist mainly of hardwoods in the clearcut treatment, and mixed conifers and hardwoods in the partial cut and uncut treatments, with more hardwood components in the partial. Further monitoring is required to verify this premise.},

However, community composition may be driven by biotic or abiotic forces, and these vary with changes in habitat structure and resource supply associated with forest land use. To evaluate these changes, we compiled comprehensive data on the species composition of soil animal communities and environmental factors in forest types varying in land-use intensity in each of three regions in Germany, i.e., coniferous, young managed, old managed, and unmanaged beech forests. Coniferous forests featured high amounts of leaf litter and low microbial biomass concentrations contrasting in particular unmanaged beech forests. However, soil animal diversity and functional community composition differed little between forest types, indicating resilience against disturbance and forest land use. Structural equation modelling suggested that despite a significant influence of forest management on resource abundance and quality, the biomass of most soil fauna functional groups was not directly affected by forest management or resource abundance/quality, potentially because microorganisms hamper the propagation of nutrients to higher trophic levels. Instead, detritivore biomass depended heavily on soil pH. Macrofauna decomposers thrived at high pH, whereas mesofauna decomposers benefitted from low soil pH, but also from low biomass of macrofauna decomposers, potentially due to habitat modification by macrofauna decomposers. The strong influence of soil pH shows that decomposer communities are structured predominantly by regional abiotic factors exceeding the role of local biotic factors such as forest type.},

We comparedh litter invertebrates among samples of leaf–litter substrate samples in microcosms either with or without individual salamanders. We used mesh leaf–litter bags to quantify leaf–litter decomposition and temporal changes in invertebrate abundance and community composition during colonization of new litter by invertebrates. We report that substrates within microcosms with P. cinereus had more podomorphic Collembola, fewer enchytraeid worms and fewer macroinvertebrate detritivores than controls at the end of the 3 month experiment. Total invertebrate density, and densities of podomorphic Collembola and Acari increased more rapidly in litter bags within salamander microcosms than in controls. In contrast, entomobryid Collembola were fewer in litter bags in salamander microcosms in comparison to controls. However, salamanders had no effect on leaf–litter decomposition rates. We hypothesize that salamander predation enhanced microbidetritivore mesofauna densities by (1) reducing numbers of larger detritivores that compete with mesofauna, and/or by (2) providing a subsidy in the form of salamander feces that promoted growth of microﬂora. Further, we hypothesize that increases of mesofauna in salamander microcosms compensated for effects on litter decomposition that may have resulted from reductions in detritivorous macrofauna.},

The present investigation of local distribution of P. cinereus was carried out in 2 such habitat types during the summers of 1957 and 1958.},

	abstract = {The amount of carbon stored in deadwood is equivalent to about 8 per cent of the global forest carbon stocks1. The decomposition of deadwood is largely governed by climate2–5 with decomposer groups—such as microorganisms and insects—contributing to variations in the decomposition rates2,6,7. At the global scale, the contribution of insects to the decomposition of deadwood and carbon release remains poorly understood7. Here we present a field experiment of wood decomposition across 55 forest sites and 6 continents. We find that the deadwood decomposition rates increase with temperature, and the strongest temperature effect is found at high precipitation levels. Precipitation affects the decomposition rates negatively at low temperatures and positively at high temperatures. As a net effect—including the direct consumption by insects and indirect effects through interactions with microorganisms—insects accelerate the decomposition in tropical forests (3.9\% median mass loss per year). In temperate and boreal forests, we find weak positive and negative effects with a median mass loss of 0.9 per cent and −0.1 per cent per year, respectively. Furthermore, we apply the experimentally derived decomposition function to a global map of deadwood carbon synthesized from empirical and remote-sensing data, obtaining an estimate of 10.9 ± 3.2 petagram of carbon per year released from deadwood globally, with 93 per cent originating from tropical forests. Globally, the net effect of insects may account for 29 per cent of the carbon flux from deadwood, which suggests a functional importance of insects in the decomposition of deadwood and the carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {Background
Managing forests for timber while protecting wildlife habitat is of increasing concern. Amphibians may be particularly sensitive to forest management practices due to their unique biology; however, it is not clear how different species respond to timber harvest practices—particularly over longer time scales.

Methods
Here we report on the differential responses of two salamander species—the eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus Green) and the eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens Rafinesque)—to forest harvesting, by examining communities across a 25-year chronosequence of regenerating shelterwood harvests.

Results
Populations of both species were lowest immediately after harvest, but increased at substantially different rates. Red-backed salamander populations were highest in 20–25 year-old shelterwoods—significantly higher than in mature, unharvested, control (100–120 year old) stands. Eastern newt populations, however, were greatest in unharvested control stands and still had not recovered to population levels found in mature stands in the 25 years since harvest. Red-backed salamander abundances were strongly tied to stand age as well as abundance of decayed coarse woody debris, suggesting that timber harvests influence some wildlife species by affecting a suite of interacting habitat variables that change over time. In contrast, newt abundances were not directly related to stand age but were more related to downed wood and vegetation characteristics. Our results highlight markedly variable responses by two common salamander species to forest harvesting—species with markedly different life histories and reproductive patterns—and that time since harvest may be useful in predicting abundance.},

	abstract = {Woodland salamanders are among the most abundant vertebrate animals in temperate deciduous forests of eastern North America. Because of their abundance, woodland salamanders are responsible for the transformation of nutrients and translocation of energy between highly disparate levels of trophic organization: detrital food webs and high-order predators. However, the spatial extent of woodland salamanders’ role in the ecosystem is likely contingent upon the distribution of their biomass throughout the forest. We sought to determine if natural environmental gradients influence the fine-scale distribution and density of Southern Ravine Salamanders (Plethodon richmondi) and Cumberland Plateau Salamanders (P. kentucki). We addressed this objective by constructing occupancy, co-occurrence, and abundance models from temporally replicated surveys within an old-growth forest in the Cumberland Plateau region of Kentucky. We found that Plethodon richmondi had a more restricted fine-scale distribution than P. kentucki (mean occupancy probability [] = 0.737) and exhibited variable density, from {\textless}250 to {\textgreater}1000 individuals per hectare, associated with increased soil moisture and reduced solar exposure due to slope face. While more ubiquitously distributed ( = 0.95), P. kentucki density varied from {\textless}400 to {\textgreater}1,000 individuals per hectare and was inversely related to increased solar exposure from canopy disturbance and landscape convexity. Our data suggest co-occurrence patterns of P. richmondi and P. kentucki are influenced primarily by abiotic conditions within the forest, and that populations likely occur independently and without evidence of biotic interaction. Given the critical role that woodland salamanders play in the maintenance of forest health, regions that support large populations of woodland salamanders, such as those highlighted in this study—mesic forest stands on north-to-east facing slopes with dense canopy and abundant natural cover, may provide enhanced ecosystem services and support the stability of the total forest.},

Yet, the amount of time until salamander populations rebound and the factors limiting recovery after harvesting are unknown. We compared the effects of six oak regeneration practices to a control, representing a disturbance gradient from no treatment to silvicultural clearcut, on the relative abundance and reproductive demography of terrestrial salamanders through 13-years post-harvest. Following the experimental disturbance, relative abundance of terrestrial salamanders in treatments that opened the canopy were significantly and persistently lower than in either untreated control stands or midstory herbicide treatments. In general, this trend persisted through 9–13 years after treatment. Changes to demography of commonly captured salamanders varied by species, but Plethodon cinereus had a greater proportion of juveniles in unharvested treatments 7–13-years post-harvest, and Desmognathus ochrophaeus had a greater proportion of juveniles and a greater number of eggs/female in unharvested treatments 1–6-years post-harvest. Population modeling of P. cinereus indicated that adult survival had the greatest elasticity of the vital rates. Further, {\textgreater}60 years may be needed before P. cinereus reduced by the observed decline could reach pre-harvest levels of abundance. Of the treatments with canopy disturbance, the group selection harvest had the greatest abundances of salamanders 7–13-years post-harvest, but when coupled with future stand entries, the volume of wood fiber extracted, costs of harvesting, reduced sprouting of oaks, and soil disturbances, this method may not have the best balance of ecological and economic sustainability in central Appalachian hardwood forest.},

Forest fragments were relatively similar in vegeta tion and ranged in area from 0.5 to 21.5 ha. Samples were collected by pitfall traps from forest-fragment interior and edge and from the surrounding agro-urban environment. Abundance and species richness of carabids was lowest in the contiguous forest and highest in the fragment surroundings. Contiguous forest had none, large (9.6-21.5 ha) and medium-sized forest fragments (4.2-8.2 ha) a few, and small fragments (0.5-3.0 ha) several species typically found in the surrounding open habitats. High carabid diversity in the small fragments and in the surroundings was probably related to the higher vegetational diversity in such sites. High diversity of vegetation, in turn, was due to moderate human disturbance and effects of vegetation succession. Most of the abundant carabid species were non-randomly distributed among the habitat types. Some specialized forest carabids were caught exclusively in contiguous forest and only the most generalized forest species were obtained from small forest fragments. These results indicate that in order to preserve the integrity of forest arthropod faunas in urban areas it is essential to leave large, continuous forest tracts untouched to preserve specialist species and forest species assemblages.},

Related to this, I study the conservation needs of carabids. The reviewed studies showed that habitat fragmentation affects carabid assemblages. Many species that require habitat types found in interiors of fragments are threatened by fragmentation. On the other hand, the species composition of small fragments of habitat (up to a few hectares) is often altered by species invading from the surroundings. Recommendations for mitigating these adverse effects include maintenance of large habitat patches and connections between them. Furthermore, landscape homogenisation should be avoided by maintaining heterogeneity of habitat types. It appears that at least in the Northern Hemisphere there is enough data about carabids for them to be fruitfully used to signal changes in land use practices. Many carabid species have been classified as threatened. Maintenance of the red-listed carabids in the landscape requires species-specific or assemblage-specific measures.},

Numbers of salamanders were lower in three recently distrurbed habitats than in adjacent old-growth control stands. The frequency of above-ground activity by both species of salamanders was positively correlated with the density of understory vegetation and the depth of leaf litter. Small-scale habitat disruption associated with harvesting firewood increased the numbers of the terrestrial eft stage of the red-spotted newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) but had no effect on numbers of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus). A recently clearcut area had fewer red-backed salamanders than adjacent old-growth forest had, but the numbers of salamanders in a 60-year-old second-growth forest were indistinguishable from those in the adjacent old-growth forest.

	abstract = {We examined trade-offs between current reproduction and future reproductive potential in a terrestrial salamander (Plethodon cinereus) in outdoor enclosures. We raised females that differed in brooding status under manipulations of food level and tail condition in two years (1993 and 1994), and measured the effects of our treatments on current reproductive success (egg survival) and indicators of future reproductive potential (female growth and production of ova). Current reproductive success depended strongly on clutch size but not resource availability. Brood abandonment was higher among females with small clutches. Both brooding status and tail condition affected future reproductive potential. Brooding females gained less mass and produced fewer new ova than nonbrooders. Tail loss resulted in increased tail regeneration but decreased production of new ova. These strong main effects were consistent between years, despite differences in experimental protocol and limited sample sizes. Food levels affected female growth only in interaction with brooding status, and these effects differed between years. Gain in mass was affected by this interaction more strongly in 1993 than in 1994, and tail regeneration was only affected in 1994. Understanding costs of reproduction in natural populations will require understanding how the condition of both the organism and its environment influence energy allocation to current reproduction and different components of future reproductive potential.},

	abstract = {Two species of salamander, Plethodon cinereus, and Plethodon hoffmani were used in experiments designed to test the hypothesis that food is the object of competition. Plethodon hoffmani occurs in the Appalachian Ridge and Valley Province where it appears to exclude the closely related and contiguously allopatric P. cinereus. Detailed field observations and a laboratory experiment confirm Jaeger's (1972) hypothesis that the food of salamanders could be limited in availability during dry weather and suggest that the cause of the low availability is the reduced mobility of the salamanders rather than a reduced food supply. However, because stomach content data and behavioral observations indicate that salamanders do not forage when the surface is dry, it was reasoned that food competition could occur under only two restricted conditions: (1) when more than one animal is isolated under damp refugia, such as rocks and logs, during dry weather, and (2) when many animals emerge onto the surface to forage when wet weather follows a prolonged dry period. Empirical evidence suggests that salamanders do not clump in refugia as the habitat dries out and that they do not surface simultaneously to forage after a dry period. Thus, even though food is periodically unavailable, the staggered feeding schedule prevents the density of salamanders from ever reaching competitive levels. Interference mechanisms are not ruled out as mechanisms of the observed spacing patterns. Competition for space is suggested as an alternative to the food competition hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Small-scale distribution of ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) was examined, based on catches among 300 pitfall traps, in a coniferous forest in southern Finland. The sample from the whole snow-free season comprised 2405 individuals of twenty-two species. Each of the most numerous species (Pterostichus oblongopunctatus (F.), Calathus micropterus (Dft.), Leistus terminatus (Hellw. in Pz.), Notiophilus biguttatus (F.) and Cychrus caraboides (L.)), was non-randomly distributed and formed aggregations within the site of c. 1.3 ha in area. Although the five species occurred in every microhabitat defined in the plot, four of them (N. biguttatus was an exception) were more abundantly found in certain microhabitat types than in the others. In addition to vegetation around the traps, the numbers of Formica ants in the traps correlated with the numbers of carabids caught, mostly negatively. The considerable variation in catches and species richness among single traps and among blocks of 16 traps tended to even out, when larger subsamples were taken from the total pool (blocks of 48 traps). The distribution patterns observed within the plot were compared to a reference data set from similar habitat in the same region. Species distributions among microhabitats were slightly different in the reference set and the predictive success was relatively poor, probably due to different scales of study in the two data sets. Variation in species distribution in the two spatial scales studied (within a habitat patch and among them) is supposedly due to different factors. Although no direct evidence is available from our study, area, we suggest that active microhabitat selection explains the small-scale distribution within the study plot, whereas dynamics of local populations, influenced by regional-scale differences in habitat composition, are the most likely explanation for the distribution patterns among habitat patches.},

	abstract = {: We studied the occurrence of carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in boreal forest fragments, their edges, and adjacent clearcuts in central Finland. Beetles were collected with pitfall traps along transects extending 60 m from the edge into clearcuts and 60 m into forest interior. Our main findings were that (1) species richness was significantly higher in the clearcut than in the forest fragments, (2) clearcuts hosted many open-habitat species, which increased overall species richness in these sites, (3) carabid assemblages in the edges were more similar to forest assemblages than to those found in the clearcuts, (4) no edge specialists were found, and (5) open-habitat species did not penetrate into the forest fragments from the clearcut. Because forest specialists occurred all the way to the edge on the forest side, it seems that edge effects per se do not adversely affect these species, at least in the short term. In the long term, however, habitat conditions in the edges may deteriorate for interior species because of trees falling over in strong winds, thereby reducing the size of the fragments and widening the edge zone.




Resumen: Estudiamos la presencia de escarabajos carabidos (Coleoptera, Carabidae) en fragmentos de un bosque boreal, de sus bordes y de zonas taladas adyacentes en Finlandia central. Los escarabajos fueron colectados usando trampas cubiertas a lo largo de transectos que se extendian desde 60 m del borde hacia el area de tala y 60 m hacia el interior del bosque. Nuestros resultados principales fueron: (1) la riqueza de especies fue significativamente mayor en la zona talada que en los fragmentos de bosque, (2) las zonas taladas hospedaron muchas especies de habitat abierto, lo cual incremento la riqueza general de especies en estos sitios, (3) los ensamblajes de carabidos en los bordes fueron mas similares a los ensamblajes del bosque, que aquellos en las zonas taladas, (4) no se encontraron especialistas de borde, y (5) las especies de habitat abierto no penetraron de las zonas taladas hacia los fragmentos de bosque. Debido a que los especialistas de bosque aparecieron a todo lo largo del borde en el lado del bosque, aparentemente los efectos de borde en si no afectan adversamente a estas especies, al menos a corto plazo. Sin embargo, a largo plazo las condiciones del habitat en los bordes podrian deteriorar para las especies del interior, debido a la caida de arboles ocasionada por vientos fuertes, lo cual reduce el tamano de los fragmentos, ampliando la zona de borde.},

Most species were known to have wide geographic distributions in Canada and Alaska but many species seemed to respond to disturbance on a site-specific basis. Contrary to findings of similar studies, no species could be characterized as “mature-forest specialists”, or “forest generalists”. Forest patches and edge habitats immediately inside the forest canopy contained assemblages more closely related to mature forest than to cleared areas. Harvested areas with patches yielded catches distinct from typical clearcuts, based primarily on changes in abundance of one common species. Climatic regimes and landscape disturbance levels were the two important factors distinguishing our study from others, and we have suggested that these may influence the degree to which patches are an effective conservation tool.},

No differences in total abundance or species richness were found between stand types for carabid beetles, although abundances of four of the six most common species differed significantly. Pterostichus setosus, the most abundant species collected, was significantly more abundant in unthinned stands, while Omus cazieri, P. lama, and Carabus taedatus were more numerous in thinned stands. In contrast, both total spider abundance and species richness were significantly higher in thinned stands. Hunting spiders within the families Lycosidae and Gnaphosidae, and the funnel web-building Dictynidae were captured more often in thinned stands while sheet web spiders within Linyphiidae and Hahniidae were more abundant in unthinned stands. The forest floor within unthinned stands was structurally more diverse than in thinned stands, but this did not lead to greater overall abundance or diversity of either carabid beetles or spiders.},
