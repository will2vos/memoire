We propose a model and likelihood-based method for estimating site occupancy rates when detection probabilities are Ͻ1. The model provides a ﬂexible framework enabling covariate information to be included and allowing for missing observations. Via computer simulation, we found that the model provides good estimates of the occupancy rates, generally unbiased for moderate detection probabilities (Ͼ0.3). We estimated site occupancy rates for two anuran species at 32 wetland sites in Maryland, USA, from data collected during 2000 as part of an amphibian monitoring program, Frogwatch USA. Site occupancy rates were estimated as 0.49 for American toads (Bufo americanus), a 44\% increase over the proportion of sites at which they were actually observed, and as 0.85 for spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer), slightly above the observed proportion of 0.83.},

Feeding on both plant and animal material and scavenging are probably more significant than currently acknowledged. The most important mortality sources are abiotic factors and predators; pathogens and parasites can be important for some developmental stages. Although competition among larvae and adults does occur, the importance of competition as a community organization is not proven. Carabids are abundant in agricultural fields all over the world and may be important natural enemies of agricultural pests.},

	abstract = {Soil-inhabiting invertebrates are extremely diverse in form, differ greatly in size and numbers, and are often aggregated in horizontal and vertical distribution. Methods available for assessing populations are all based on representative samples. They include field counting, use of attractant traps or pitfall traps, and assessing numbers of invertebrates in soil samples. Invertebrates can be separated from soil either by wet or dry methods based on physical principles, or by dynamic methods which use stimuli to make them leave the samples. Physical methods of separation include hand sorting of soil, soil washing and flotation, elutriation in an upward flow of water, use of a technique which involves passing soil over plates covered with a grease film in which the invertebrates become embedded, and centrifuging soil samples in water or dense solutions so that invertebrates come to the surface. Dynamic methods suitable for most arthropods include the use of dry funnels with, high controlled temperature and moisture gradients, and wet-funnel methods which are used mainly for nematodes and echytraeid worms. Dry funnels which are easy to use are the most popular technique, but have the drawback that they do not extract eggs or resting stages. Wet funnels, which are more laborious, recover these stages, but also dead individuals. Flotation methods are best for sandy soils, whereas dry funnels are more efficient for peat or clay soils. For most soils, dry funnels are most efficient for the extraction of micro- and mesoarthropods, but flotation is usually preferable for macroarthropods.},

	abstract = {I evaluated how the abundances of two species of forest-dwelling plethodontid salamanders, Plethodon cinereus and P glutinosus, are related to moisture level and availability of cover by manipulating moisture levels and cover object density on experimental plots. I also investigated how cover and moisture influence the physical condition and activity level of the most common of the two species, P cinereus. The experiment was a 2 x 2 factorial design in which plots had either low or high densities of cover objects (rocks, logs, and coarse woody debris) and were either watered by sprinklers two to three times weekly or received no supplemental watering. Nocturnal searches of the plots revealed that watering increased the abundance of juvenile R cinereus, and increased the activity levels of both juveniles and adults. Increased densities of cover objects resulted in increased abundance of both adult and juvenile P cinereus. Plethodon glutinosus was more abundant on watered plots and on plots with high densities of cover objects than on unwatered plots and plots with low densities of cover objects. The P cinereus on plots with high densities of cover objects were of higher mass, adjusted for body length and tail length, than conspecifics on plots with low densities of cover objects. This suggests that the foraging success of terrestrial salamanders is dependent on cover object availability. The findings of this study indicate that moisture levels and cover object availability are both significant factors in regulating abundances of terrestrial salamanders, but that different species and different age-classes of the same species can vary in their responses to these factors.},

One such technique is irregular shelterwood logging, but its impacts on forest ﬂoor organisms are poorly known. Our objective was to quantify the effects of three different treatments of irregular shelterwood on population structure and the body condition of the eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) 5–6 years following harvesting. A total of 64 sites in western Québec were sampled using artiﬁcial refugia and quadrat searches. Large salamanders ({\textgreater}32 mm) were more abundant in the gap treatment than in strip, uniform, or control treatments. Small salamanders (≤32 mm) followed the same pattern, although the differences were marginal. For a given treatment, small salamanders were as abundant as large salamanders. Salamander body condition differed between the 2 years of sampling but did not differ among treatments, regardless of salamander size. We conclude that environmental conditions in irregular shelterwood treatments 5–6 years following harvesting support populations of small vertebrates on the forest ﬂoor.},

However, recent studies have suggested that potential bias may be associated with the use of coverboards compared with natural cover objects. In this study, age structure and body size (weight and snout-vent length, SVL) of P. cinereus found under coverboards and natural cover objects at Lake Clair (Quebec, Canada) were compared. Coverboards were made of Sugar Maple (Acer sacchrum), a native forest species dominant in the study area. In 2004 and 2005, a total of 162 P. cinereus were found under coverboards, and 156 P. cinereus were found under natural cover objects. No significant difference in the age structure, mean weight, or SVL of P. cinereus was observed between the two sets. This study suggests that the type of coverboard used at Lake Clair is a good method to obtain an accurate index of P. cinereus population demographics, and is similar to that expected under natural cover objects. This technique should help to establish a standard protocol that could better allow direct comparisons among studies in the future. However, more studies are needed to explain the high proportion of adult specimens found under both cover types at Lake Clair relative to studies in other regions in North America.},

	abstract = {Understanding patterns of microhabitat use among terrestrial salamanders is important for predicting their responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. The dependence of terrestrial salamanders on cutaneous respiration limits their spatial distribution to moist, humid areas. Although many studies have shown negative effects of canopy removal on terrestrial salamander abundance, some have shown potential ameliorating effects of retaining coarse woody debris (CWD) as moist refugia (critical resources in the landscape). Because cover objects like CWD retain moisture longer than ﬁne debris, terrestrial salamanders are often more locally abundant in areas of dense cover. Temporally variable environmental conditions could affect microhabitat quality and inﬂuence the ﬁne-scale spatial distributions of salamanders. Spatial and temporal variability in microhabitat use greatly inﬂuence individual detectability, which is always a challenge for terrestrial salamanders. We conducted repeated area-constrained surveys to examine variation in salamander microhabitat use of terrestrial salamanders in relation to season, year, and weather conditions. We found that time since rain (TSR) was the best predictor of relative salamander microhabitat use, but the strength of this relationship varied among years. In addition, TSR was also the best predictor of salamander surface activity. We captured most salamanders within leaf litter, but the proportion of leaf litter captures varied with TSR. Our results illustrate the importance of accounting for variable detectability when sampling for terrestrial salamanders. Disturbances which affect leaf litter depth and decomposition rates could inﬂuence the availability and quality of microhabitats and potentially increase competition among individuals for natural cover objects.},

	abstract = {Predicting how timber harvesting will inﬂuence sensitive taxa such as amphibians is of critical importance for sustainable management of forests. In 2004 and 2005, we studied the effects of four forestry treatments (clearcut with coarse woody debris [CWD] removed, clearcut with CWD retained, partial-cut of 50\% of canopy cover, and an uncut control) on movement, habitat selection, and abundance of amphibians in Maine. Four landscape-scale replicates of these four forestry treatments were created with each replicate centered on a breeding pool. A total of 8632 emerging juvenile wood frogs were captured and marked at drift fences encircling breeding pools, with 1166 marked wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), and 13,727 unmarked amphibians captured in drift fence/pitfall arrays at 16, 50, 100, and 150 m from the pools. Our capture results in the different treatments were consistent with previous studies in showing that adult abundance and habitat use differed among species, with wood frogs, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum), and eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) preferring uncut and partial-cut habitat, and adult green frogs (Rana clamitans) and American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) being more tolerant of clearcutting. Spotted salamanders also showed reduced captures with partial canopy removal and increased captures with the retention of CWD. Our results for juvenile amphibians differed from previous research, with lower captures of all study species (statistically signiﬁcant for seven of nine species) in clearcuts compared to uncut and partial-cut treatments. Clearcuts did not reduce habitat permeability for the low number of marked wood frogs that entered these treatments. Data from marked wood frogs also suggest that both density of conspeciﬁcs and habitat quality can inﬂuence habitat selection, and potentially dispersal of juvenile amphibians. The avoidance of clearcuts by juveniles of all study species suggests that this silvicultural technique may reduce both abundance and dispersal of many species, rather than just species where adults are known to be forest-dependent. Species may also be affected by partial as well as full canopy removal, and the retention of CWD may play a role in mitigating some of the effects of clearcutting.},

Despite the historical recognition that amphibians could play an important role in the movement of biomass and nutrients, very few studies have provided reliable estimates of abundance and density of amphibians to reveal their true importance. Here, we provide robust estimates of abundance and density of a dominant species, the Southern Redback Salamander (Plethodon serratus Grobman, 1944), in the oak forest ecosystem of the Ozark Highlands in Missouri. We then use the abundance and density estimates to calculate biomass and nutrient content of salamanders at our study sites in the Ozark forests. Salamanders at the Sinkin Experimental Forest comprise a large amount of protein, energy, and nutrients that greatly exceed estimates derived some 35 years ago in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Our estimates (7 300 –12 900 salamanders·ha−1) are 2–4 times greater than the values reported by Burton and Likens (1975a, Ecology, 56: 1068–1080; 1975b, Copeia, 1975: 541–546). Furthermore, we show that density estimates of other small plethodontid species reported in the literature are nearly an order of magnitude greater than that reported by Burton and Likens. We believe this indicates that previous results have underestimated the importance of salamander biomass, nutrient, and energy ﬂux, and their functional role in regulating invertebrates and carbon retention in forest ecosystems.},

We tested the functional redundancy of novel tree communities by verifying if six pairs of congeneric European and North American tree species bearing similar leaf litter traits resulted in similar ecological filters influencing the assembly of springtail (Collembola) communities at two sites. Litter biogeographic origin (native versus non-native) did not influence springtail community structure, but litter genus, which generally reflected trait differences, did. Our empirical evidence suggests that a functional trait approach may be indeed as relevant as, and complementary to, studying biogeographic origin to understand the ecological consequences of non-native tree species in soils of novel forest ecosystems.},

In boreal forests, managers are increasingly considering intensifying woody biomass removal for bioenergy, but associated functional eﬀects on soil fauna that use microhabitats associated with this biomass remain poorly understood. Two years after harvesting, we assessed the eﬀects of an increasing intensity gradient of biomass removal in a northeastern Ontario jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stand on the functional structure of Collembola and Oribatida communities, two abundant soil taxa. The gradient ranged from (1) uncut forest to (2) stem-only harvesting to intense biomass removal through (3) wholetree harvesting (stem, top and branches) with (4) stump removal and (5) additional removal of organic soil strata. Morphological and life-history response traits associated with hypothesized functions were measured to determine changes in the functional structure (species trait diversity and composition) of communities in response to the gradient and related environmental changes. We found that functional structure of communities of both taxa was overall signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by biomass removal through a compositional shift in species traits in comparison to uncut forest. Functional homogenization was observed for Oribatida communities with a loss of species that were surface-dwelling, larger, predominantly sexually reproducing and mostly micro-detritivorous. In contrast, Collembola communities were less aﬀected with only the most extreme treatment showing a more homogenized community than the uncut forest. These functional changes were mainly explained by fewer suitable microhabitats, characterized for example by a more stable microclimate as well as more abundant and diverse food resources, due to the disturbance of forest ﬂoor organic cover with harvesting. To improve sustainable management of boreal forests, long-term studies will be needed to assess if partial functional homogenization of soil mesofauna by intensive practices persists through time and may inﬂuence soil ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Woody biomass is increasingly harvested in Canadian boreal forests as a source of bioenergy. However, there is concern over the environmental sustainability of harvesting practices. Our study assessed how forest ﬂoor mesofauna communities responded to an increasing intensity gradient of biomass removal and soil disturbance in a jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forest in northeastern Ontario, and whether any modiﬁcation in community structure could be related to environmental change. Five experimental treatments were established that included a mature jack pine control stand (no recent harvesting) and harvesting of stem-only, whole-tree (stem, top and branches), whole-tree with stump removal and whole-tree with stump and forest ﬂoor (organic layer) removal. Two years after treatment application, we compared the structure of Collembola and Oribatida communities in moss, organic and mineral soil samples along this gradient. Despite both taxa showing somewhat contrasting responses, in general, each community had signiﬁcantly lower density and species richness (α-diversity) and more compositional dissimilarities in response to biomass removal compared to uncut mature stands. These diﬀerences were especially marked in the two most intense removal treatments (whole-tree harvesting with stump removal and that with the additional forest ﬂoor removal). We attributed this result to the major loss of surface-dwelling species after harvesting and along the biomass removal gradient, especially in Oribatida communities, likely due to the loss of favourable microhabitats provided by moss and woody debris. Environmental changes observed along the gradient, beyond the loss of these microhabitats, were driven by the removal of forest ﬂoor decreasing soil nutrient richness and acidity and increasing soil temperature. Forest ﬂoor mesofaunal communities were clearly modiﬁed by more intensive biomass removal practices as compared to stem-only and whole-tree biomass harvesting. Long-term studies will be needed to investigate to what extent these patterns vary through time in order to inform sustainable management of woody biomass removal in this ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Abstract   In North American boreal forests, woody biomass is increasingly becoming an attractive bioenergy feedstock as it represents a more renewable, and low carbon alternative to fossil fuel. However, concerns over the ecological sustainability of an intensification of biomass harvesting over the long term remain. We assessed the effects of a gradient of biomass removal established 20years ago in five jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stands across northeastern Ontario on the taxonomic and functional structure of ground-dwelling Collembola and Oribatida communities. Essential to soil functioning, these two major taxa of mesofauna are dependent on microhabitats and food supply such as fungi provided by woody debris. Three treatments were considered including stem-only harvesting, whole-tree harvesting (stem, tops and branches removed), and blading (whole-tree harvesting plus removal of stump and forest floor). Adjacent uncut mature (±90year-old) stands were considered as reference state conditions (i.e. the endpoint of stand development following stand replacing disturbance). Soil mesofauna were collected and environmental variables measured across all treatments. We identified species of both taxa and measured a suite of functional response traits such as body length and reproduction strategy. Compared to mature uncut forests, soil mesofaunal communities remained modified 20years after biomass harvesting, notably in the most intense practice (blading). Treatment effects were more evident in Oribatida communities both taxonomically (lower density, biomass, species diversity and shifted composition) and functionally (lower diversity and modified trait composition resulting from fewer surface-dwelling, fast-dispersing and micro-detritivorous species) than in Collembola communities. This taxa-specific response may reflect generally shorter lifespans, higher reproduction rates and faster dispersal of Collembola than Oribatida. Incomplete recovery of mesofauna was consistent with persistent modifications of soil environmental conditions in harvested plots, notably after blading. Modifications included a reduced organic cover (ground vegetation, mosses and woody debris) as well as lower organic soil thickness and moisture, which likely resulted in fewer suitable microhabitats for many species. Using complementary taxonomic and trait-based approaches to highlight the underlying mechanisms of mesofaunal responses, our study revealed that recovery is incomplete within 20years after intensive biomass removal in these boreal conifer-dominated stands, and is likely linked to stand development and associated processes. As a result, longer-term monitoring will be required to track mesofaunal community recovery through these later developmental stages.},

	abstract = {Abstract   Replacement of native deciduous forests by coniferous stands was a common consequence of former European afforestation policies. However, these changes have proven to lead to serious ecological problems. Therefore, re-establishing mixed forests with native tree species became an increasingly popular management strategy to fulfil the demands of multi-functional forestry. We report about changes in collembolan assemblages and microbial performances during conversion of pure coniferous stands to mixed forests. The study was carried out in the Black forest area (SW of Germany), where a gradient of conversion from pure spruce stands (S1) to equally mixed stands (spruce, beech, and fir) at S4, through two intermediate stages (S2 and S3) was selected. Results clearly indicated strong modifications of the collembolan communities with an enrichment of the assemblages over the course of the conversion process. Mean species richness increased by 47\% from S1 to S4 accompanied by diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson) higher at S4. Significantly different soil biota assemblages were found at each phase of the conversion process. Spatial turnover and nestedness contribute almost equally to the modification of assemblages from S1 to S2 while later on in the mixing process only spatial turnover was acting. Concomitantly, significant shifts in the functional structure of the collembolan assemblages were depicted, deep-dwelling collembolan (euedaphic) being, surprisingly, the most responsive group. In contrast, neither microbial nor coarse environmental parameters were influenced by the factor “conversion phase”. We suggest that stimulation of Collembolan communities after the mixing process was mainly due to the input of more suitable food sources and/or microhabitat increases. Our findings underline the crucial role of aboveground processes on the belowground system, with the intensity and scheme of the mixing-process as important factors to consider when aiming at soil biodiversity improvement in forest systems.},

Occupancy models have emerged as a popular approach for inferring species occurrence because they account for problems associated with imperfect detection in field surveys. Current models, however, are limited because they assume ­covariates are independent (i.e., indirect effects do not occur). Here, we combined structural equation and occupancy models to investigate complex influences on species occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection. These two methods are inherently compatible because they both provide means to make inference on latent or unobserved quantities based on observed data. Our models evaluated the direct and indirect roles of cattle grazing, water chemistry, vegetation, nonnative fishes, and pond permanence on the ­occurrence of six pond-breeding amphibians, two of which are threatened: the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and the California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii). While cattle had strong effects on pond vegetation and water chemistry, their overall effects on amphibian occurrence were small compared to the consistently negative effects of nonnative fish. Fish strongly reduced occurrence probabilities for four of five native amphibians, including both species of conservation concern. These results could help to identify drivers of amphibian declines and to prioritize strategies for amphibian conservation. More generally, this approach facilitates a more mechanistic representation of ideas about the causes of species distributions in space and time. As shown here, occupancy modeling and structural equation modeling are readily combined, and bring rich sets of techniques that may provide unique theoretical and applied insights into basic ecological questions.},

Life-cycle strategies of two low-altitude species, found predominantly below 600 m, and two species caught above 600 m a.s.l., have been determined, using mandible wear to identify whether the females breed in the calendar year that they emerge as adults or in the year following.

Nebria salina has an annual cycle at 630 m. Pterostichus madidus and Calathus fuscipes were both biennial at altitudes above 300 m although predominantly annual at low altitude. N.gyllenhali was biennial above 600 m and it is not known whether it is able to switch to an annual cycle at low altitude.

4
Both N.salina and N.gyllenhali ceased activity soon after emergence, an adaptation which preserves their mandibles from wear.

5
At altitudes of 305 m and 430 m, P.madidus and C.fuscipes entered the breeding season with 33\% and 56\% reduction in mandible tip length, possibly reducing their reproductive output.

6
The necessity for relatively sharp mandibles on entry into the breeding season may restrict the capacity of carabids to respond to a temperature change by switching from annual to biennial cycles, and vice versa, adding support to the suggestion that carabids are more likely to respond to climate change by shifting distributions than by physiological adaptation.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121298},
	abstract = {Global change is reshaping climatic conditions at a tempo that exceeds natural migration rates for most tree species. As climate change amplifies the disparity between species’ adaptive capacity and local climates, tree populations risk becoming geographically stranded in increasingly unsuitable conditions. This mismatch may cause catastrophic losses of key forest ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, habitat provisioning, and forest products. In response, forest managers and researchers are developing a suite of climate-adaptive strategies designed to sustain forest diversity and function. Among these, forest assisted migration (FAM) involves the movement of planting stock from source populations to locations either within or beyond their current ranges. The goal is to establish forests that can survive in today's climate and expected to thrive in future conditions, thereby sustaining ecosystem good and services. Because FAM is still in its infancy, implementation is limited by many uncertainties. Climatically derived seed sourcing is needed to ensure that planting stock possesses the ecophysiological amplitude to withstand both current and future climatic conditions at the destination site. Additionally, more knowledge about the impacts of local herbivores and intraspecific competition are needed because these drivers will co-regulate seedling success along with climate. Practically, these uncertainties must be addressed to instill in managers sufficient confidence that FAM investments will fulfill long-term management and societal goals relative to other silvicultural approaches. The Desired REgeneration through Assisted Migration (DREAM) framework is an international collaboration that uses basic and applied research to reduce these uncertainties and derive climate-informed planting approaches. DREAM is self-reinforcing in that each step in the process informs and strengthens subsequent phases. Namely, it sources seed in a climatically informed manner, experimentally tests this sourced stock to probe for physiological maladaptation under controlled settings, grows the stock in the field under a range of silvicultural scenarios, and finally forecasts long-term outcomes using models parameterized from the controlled- and field-tests. In this paper, we describe the DREAM framework and illustrate aspects of its implementation drawing from two experimental sites: one in Québec, Canada and one in Wisconsin, USA. Moreover, we place the DREAM study into the broader FAM context by briefly contrasting it with other operational examples throughout North America. Knowledge gained from this research-management collaboration will expand current reforestation paradigms to include future climate-adaptive ones that aim to use the right seed, planted in the right places, under the right conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract   Terrestrial salamander abundance in North American forests is closely associated with forest characteristics, and salamander populations typically decline following timber removal. However, salamander responses to timber harvest vary considerably from one study to the next – some studies have shown limited or no effects whereas others have found harvest-related declines of up to 95\%. To estimate overall effect sizes of timber harvest on salamander populations and to examine factors that contribute to variation in salamander responses to harvest, we carried out a meta-analysis of published studies of the effects of timber harvesting on terrestrial salamander abundance. Based on 108 salamander species/treatment combinations from 24 studies, we found mean harvest-related declines ranged from 29\% (95\% CI=−2\% to 51\%) for long-term responses to partial canopy removal to 62\% (95\% CI=29\% to 80\%) for short-term responses to clearcutting. Multivariate mixed models suggested that clearcutting had a modestly greater impact on salamander populations than partial harvest and that decreases following harvest were more pronounced at sites with warmer summer high temperatures. In addition, active sampling of salamanders (e.g., surface counts) led to greater apparent effects of timber harvest than passive sampling (e.g., cover boards or pitfall traps), suggesting that sampling methodology influenced the perceived effects of harvest. In the studies evaluated, salamander numbers almost always declined following timber removal, but salamanders were never extirpated and populations typically increased as forests regenerated.},

Although the impact of clear-cutting has received much attention, the widely-used practice of selective logging (in which individual trees or small groups of trees are removed leaving gaps in the forest canopy) has been incompletely studied. We examined the effects of such logging on the distributions of individual redback salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, in a mixed deciduous forest that had been harvested 1 yr earlier. Salamander densities and distributions were assessed using thorough searches of leaf litter and cover objects in quadrats along transects which passed from gaps into the surrounding forest. Comparisons were made between quadrats in three location categories: inside the gaps, along gap edges, and within the forest. We found much variation in salamander numbers among transects, but detected no significant differences in the densities of salamanders among the three location categories. Similarly, salamanders did not show different degrees of within-quadrat grouping among the location categories. These results suggest that the newly formed gaps produced by selective logging did not strongly affect the distributions of P. cinereus in the first year following harvest.},

	doi = {10.1111/oik.03677},
	abstract = {Plant–soil interactions are increasingly recognized to play a major role in terrestrial ecosystems functioning. However, few studies to date have focused on slow dynamic ecosystems such as forests. As they are vertically stratified by multiple vegetation strata, canopy tree removal by thinning operations could alter forest plant community through tree canopy opening. Very little is known about cascading effects on soil biodiversity.

We conducted a large-scale, multi-site assessment of collembolan assemblage response to long-term canopy tree removal in sessile oak Quercus petraea temperate forests. A total of 33 experimental plots were studied covering a large gradient of canopy tree basal area, stand age and local abiotic contexts.

Collembolan abundance strongly declined with canopy tree removal in early forest successional stage and this was mediated by negative effect of understory plant community composition changes, i.e. shift from moss and forb to tree seedling, fern, shrub and grass species. Negative effect of this composition shift on collembolan species richness was largely offset by positive effect of the increase in understory plant species richness. This gives support to both the plant mass-ratio and functional diversity hypotheses. Collembolan functional groups had contrasting response patterns, which were mediated by different ecological factors. Epedaphic (r-strategist) abundance and species richness increased with canopy tree removal in relation with the increase in understory plant species richness. In contrast, euedaphic (K-strategist) abundance and species richness declined with canopy tree removal in early forest successional stage in relation with changes in understory plant community composition and species richness, as well as microclimatic conditions.

Overall, our study provides experimental evidence that forest plant community can be a strong driver of collembolan assemblages. It also emphasizes the role of trees as foundation species of forest ecosystems that can shape soil biodiversity through their regulation of understory plant community and ecosystem abiotic conditions.},

	doi = {10.1111/2041-210x.13858},
	abstract = {Large-scale, long-term biodiversity monitoring is essential to conservation, land management and identifying threats to biodiversity. However, multispecies surveys are prone to various types of observation error, including false-positive/false-negative detection and misclassification, where a species is thought to have been encountered but not correctly identified. Previous methods assume an imperfect classifier produces species-level classifications, but in practice, particularly with human observers, we may end up with extraspecific classifications including ‘unknown’, morphospecies designations and taxonomic identifications coarser than species. Disregarding these types of species misclassification in biodiversity monitoring datasets can bias estimates of ecologically important quantities such as demographic rates, occurrence and species richness. Here we present a joint classification-occupancy model that accounts for species non-detection and misclassification. Our framework accommodates extinction and colonization dynamics, allows for additional uncertain ‘morphospecies’ designations and makes use of individual specimens with known species identities in a semi-supervised setting. We compare the performance of our model to a classification-only model that discards information about occupancy and encounter rate. We illustrate our model with an empirical case study of the carabid beetle (Carabidae) community at the National Ecological Observatory Network Niwot Ridge Mountain Research Station, near Boulder, CO, USA. We also use simulations to evaluate model performance through validation metrics where varying fractions of the data are confirmed. The model supported imperfect classifier accuracy and favoured certain true species classifications strongly for some morphospecies. The model outperformed (e.g. precision) the reduced model that discarded occupancy information, and these differences were most pronounced for abundant species. Spatial and temporal dynamics from modelled occupancy and encounter rates may inform species misclassification probability, but this idea has not yet been tested. Our statistical framework explores this opportunity, and can be applied to datasets with imperfect species detection and classification, limited verification data and non-species classifications.},

Here, C stocks were estimated for a northern temperate mixed forest located in eastern Québec, Canada, five years after clear-cutting and partial-cutting, either with or without a brushing treatment to control the competing vegetation. The biomass of the aboveground vegetation (trees, saplings, understory), litter and woody debris (coarse, small, fine), as well as the roots (diameter ≤ 1.5 cm) was evaluated. Additionally, soil C pools up to a depth of 35 cm of the mineral soil were assessed. Total ecosystem C stocks were influenced by the overstory treatments reflecting harvest intensities. Although the belowground C pools were major contributors to total ecosystem C stocks, silvicultural treatments only influenced forest floor and aboveground C stocks.

	abstract = {Salamanders represent exceptional indicators for understanding environmental change and forest degradation. Coverboards, a type of artificial cover object, have become a popular tool for censusing salamanders given their low cost of installation and lack of danger to the environment and animals. Previous work has suggested that a variety of factors including wood type, coverboard size and thickness, and array design may impact coverboard usage by salamanders, potentially confounding results. Therefore, when comparing salamander counts across studies, or even within multi-year studies, it is necessary to standardize study designs. We assessed how coverboard age and the coverboard aging process affects coverboard usage by red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), using arrays composed of boards with three different ages (zero, one, and five-year old boards) in Palmer, Massachusetts from 2017–2019. We found that there was no difference in salamander preference for zero- or one-year old boards, but there was a strong preference for five-year old boards. We also found that board aging does not strongly impact preference. Factors such as snout-vent length and age class were not significantly correlated with board age. For multi-year studies greater than two years, we recommend either replacing boards every 2–3 years before they become significantly more attractive to salamanders or weathering boards for greater than two years prior to deploying them. Ensuring comparable study designs will likely eliminate many of the conflicting results that are found in coverboard literature and we echo many workers who call for standardization.},

We also compare performance of four types of pitfall traps across five habitats. Carabid species composition from litter washing and funnel extraction was similar but washing revealed higher densities. Large-bodied species predominated in pitfall samples and small-bodied species predominated in litter samples. Uncovered, round pitfall traps yielded generally higher catches than rectangular or covered, round traps but the pattern was not consistent over all species or the five habitats. Ecological studies of carabid populations and assemblages using pitfall traps may be improved if they are both designed and interpreted in light of the biology of the group and with regard to the deficiencies of pitfall trapping as discussed here and elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Abstract   Forest fragmentation by management activities has been implicated in the decline of forest biodiversity. Even though boreal ecosystems are generally deemed quite resilient to disturbance effects, high contemporary levels of disturbance might push forest-interior species toward decline or extinction. In this study, we examined beetle communities in forest patches of different sizes, including clearcuts, residual postharvest patches from 0.03 to 50ha in size, and large mature forest tracts ({\textgreater}1000ha). Overall, community structure follows a gradient between clearcuts and large mature forest tracts, even if patch size effects were more difficult to detect among patches {\textgreater}2.5ha. Beetles were most abundant in clearcuts, and species richness was highest in small tree groups (0.03–0.05ha). The effects of fragmentation were strongly conditioned by beetle feeding habits. Predators and xylophagous beetles were mostly associated with clearcuts or smaller patches (i.e., small tree groups or large tree groups [0.3–0.5ha]), whereas fungivorous beetles were associated with forest-interior habitats. Although many forest-interior species were still present in relatively small patches 1–5years after harvesting, negative effects of habitat fragmentation on these species might increase in the long-term.},

Abundance of Synuchus impunctatus Say was significantly higher in clear-cut compared with uncut control strips. There were no within-species differences between selectively cut and uncut plots. None of these two silvicultural systems had any significant impacts on species diversity and richness 613 years after treatment. Although we observed an effect of strip clear-cutting on the abundance of S. impunctatus in this northern hardwood forest, the discrepancy between the response of carabids to forest disturbance in this study compared with other studies in different ecological regions suggests that the same carabid beetle species cannot be used a...},

	abstract = {The terrestrial salamander Plethodon richmondi Shenandoah occurs primarily in areas of talus, apparently excluded from surrounding areas of deep soil by Plethodon cinereus. Although the two species are closely related, P. r. shenandoah grows to a longer body length and has a broader head. All age classes of P. r. Shenandoah emigrate out of the talus and are found within 3 m of the talus edge, but only adults which are as large as or larger than the largest P. cinereus are able to survive farther than about 3 m from the talus. This distribution is not explained by a tendency for large adults to wander more than juveniles. The large P. r. Shenandoah in the soil take prey that are significantly larger than prey taken by cohabiting P. cinereus, indicating that food may be the limited resource for which competition occurs. Both species are euryphagic and prey upon the same taxa of small animals. Food is periodically limited in availability, but not in abundance. Following a rain, salamanders forage freely and consume a large quantity of prey, based on stomach contents, but prey become increasingly unavailable as the soil and leaf litter dry and the salamanders are restricted to isolated pockets of moisture. Stomachs remain virtually empty until the next rain, at which time they are full again indicating that the abundance of prey is not greatly affected by the intervening dryness. Food may periodically become a limited resource during long dry seasons and as such may affect the survival of the salamanders or their ability to produce eggs.},

Stopframe video analyses of feedings were made using 19 salamanders of varying body size and four prey types chosen to resemble items in the natural diet of the species. Five morphological features of each salamander, length and width of prey items, and 15 kinematic variables were used to describe each feeding trial.},
