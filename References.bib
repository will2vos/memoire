Feeding on both plant and animal material and scavenging are probably more significant than currently acknowledged. The most important mortality sources are abiotic factors and predators; pathogens and parasites can be important for some developmental stages. Although competition among larvae and adults does occur, the importance of competition as a community organization is not proven. Carabids are abundant in agricultural fields all over the world and may be important natural enemies of agricultural pests.},

	abstract = {Soil-inhabiting invertebrates are extremely diverse in form, differ greatly in size and numbers, and are often aggregated in horizontal and vertical distribution. Methods available for assessing populations are all based on representative samples. They include field counting, use of attractant traps or pitfall traps, and assessing numbers of invertebrates in soil samples. Invertebrates can be separated from soil either by wet or dry methods based on physical principles, or by dynamic methods which use stimuli to make them leave the samples. Physical methods of separation include hand sorting of soil, soil washing and flotation, elutriation in an upward flow of water, use of a technique which involves passing soil over plates covered with a grease film in which the invertebrates become embedded, and centrifuging soil samples in water or dense solutions so that invertebrates come to the surface. Dynamic methods suitable for most arthropods include the use of dry funnels with, high controlled temperature and moisture gradients, and wet-funnel methods which are used mainly for nematodes and echytraeid worms. Dry funnels which are easy to use are the most popular technique, but have the drawback that they do not extract eggs or resting stages. Wet funnels, which are more laborious, recover these stages, but also dead individuals. Flotation methods are best for sandy soils, whereas dry funnels are more efficient for peat or clay soils. For most soils, dry funnels are most efficient for the extraction of micro- and mesoarthropods, but flotation is usually preferable for macroarthropods.},

	abstract = {I evaluated how the abundances of two species of forest-dwelling plethodontid salamanders, Plethodon cinereus and P glutinosus, are related to moisture level and availability of cover by manipulating moisture levels and cover object density on experimental plots. I also investigated how cover and moisture influence the physical condition and activity level of the most common of the two species, P cinereus. The experiment was a 2 x 2 factorial design in which plots had either low or high densities of cover objects (rocks, logs, and coarse woody debris) and were either watered by sprinklers two to three times weekly or received no supplemental watering. Nocturnal searches of the plots revealed that watering increased the abundance of juvenile R cinereus, and increased the activity levels of both juveniles and adults. Increased densities of cover objects resulted in increased abundance of both adult and juvenile P cinereus. Plethodon glutinosus was more abundant on watered plots and on plots with high densities of cover objects than on unwatered plots and plots with low densities of cover objects. The P cinereus on plots with high densities of cover objects were of higher mass, adjusted for body length and tail length, than conspecifics on plots with low densities of cover objects. This suggests that the foraging success of terrestrial salamanders is dependent on cover object availability. The findings of this study indicate that moisture levels and cover object availability are both significant factors in regulating abundances of terrestrial salamanders, but that different species and different age-classes of the same species can vary in their responses to these factors.},

One such technique is irregular shelterwood logging, but its impacts on forest ﬂoor organisms are poorly known. Our objective was to quantify the effects of three different treatments of irregular shelterwood on population structure and the body condition of the eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) 5–6 years following harvesting. A total of 64 sites in western Québec were sampled using artiﬁcial refugia and quadrat searches. Large salamanders ({\textgreater}32 mm) were more abundant in the gap treatment than in strip, uniform, or control treatments. Small salamanders (≤32 mm) followed the same pattern, although the differences were marginal. For a given treatment, small salamanders were as abundant as large salamanders. Salamander body condition differed between the 2 years of sampling but did not differ among treatments, regardless of salamander size. We conclude that environmental conditions in irregular shelterwood treatments 5–6 years following harvesting support populations of small vertebrates on the forest ﬂoor.},

	abstract = {Artificial cover objects or coverboards have been widely used to study Eastern Red-backed Salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), a species that is very abundant in eastern North America and known to be one of the most common vertebrates within its geographical range. However, recent studies have suggested that potential bias may be associated with the use of coverboards compared with natural cover objects. In this study, age structure and body size (weight and snout-vent length, SVL) of P. cinereus found under coverboards and natural cover objects at Lake Clair (Quebec, Canada) were compared. Coverboards were made of Sugar Maple (Acer sacchrum), a native forest species dominant in the study area. In 2004 and 2005, a total of 162 P. cinereus were found under coverboards, and 156 P. cinereus were found under natural cover objects. No significant difference in the age structure, mean weight, or SVL of P. cinereus was observed between the two sets. This study suggests that the type of coverboard used at Lake Clair is a good method to obtain an accurate index of P. cinereus population demographics, and is similar to that expected under natural cover objects. This technique should help to establish a standard protocol that could better allow direct comparisons among studies in the future. However, more studies are needed to explain the high proportion of adult specimens found under both cover types at Lake Clair relative to studies in other regions in North America.},

	abstract = {Understanding patterns of microhabitat use among terrestrial salamanders is important for predicting their responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. The dependence of terrestrial salamanders on cutaneous respiration limits their spatial distribution to moist, humid areas. Although many studies have shown negative effects of canopy removal on terrestrial salamander abundance, some have shown potential ameliorating effects of retaining coarse woody debris (CWD) as moist refugia (critical resources in the landscape). Because cover objects like CWD retain moisture longer than ﬁne debris, terrestrial salamanders are often more locally abundant in areas of dense cover. Temporally variable environmental conditions could affect microhabitat quality and inﬂuence the ﬁne-scale spatial distributions of salamanders. Spatial and temporal variability in microhabitat use greatly inﬂuence individual detectability, which is always a challenge for terrestrial salamanders. We conducted repeated area-constrained surveys to examine variation in salamander microhabitat use of terrestrial salamanders in relation to season, year, and weather conditions. We found that time since rain (TSR) was the best predictor of relative salamander microhabitat use, but the strength of this relationship varied among years. In addition, TSR was also the best predictor of salamander surface activity. We captured most salamanders within leaf litter, but the proportion of leaf litter captures varied with TSR. Our results illustrate the importance of accounting for variable detectability when sampling for terrestrial salamanders. Disturbances which affect leaf litter depth and decomposition rates could inﬂuence the availability and quality of microhabitats and potentially increase competition among individuals for natural cover objects.},

	abstract = {Predicting how timber harvesting will inﬂuence sensitive taxa such as amphibians is of critical importance for sustainable management of forests. In 2004 and 2005, we studied the effects of four forestry treatments (clearcut with coarse woody debris [CWD] removed, clearcut with CWD retained, partial-cut of 50\% of canopy cover, and an uncut control) on movement, habitat selection, and abundance of amphibians in Maine. Four landscape-scale replicates of these four forestry treatments were created with each replicate centered on a breeding pool. A total of 8632 emerging juvenile wood frogs were captured and marked at drift fences encircling breeding pools, with 1166 marked wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), and 13,727 unmarked amphibians captured in drift fence/pitfall arrays at 16, 50, 100, and 150 m from the pools. Our capture results in the different treatments were consistent with previous studies in showing that adult abundance and habitat use differed among species, with wood frogs, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum), and eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) preferring uncut and partial-cut habitat, and adult green frogs (Rana clamitans) and American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) being more tolerant of clearcutting. Spotted salamanders also showed reduced captures with partial canopy removal and increased captures with the retention of CWD. Our results for juvenile amphibians differed from previous research, with lower captures of all study species (statistically signiﬁcant for seven of nine species) in clearcuts compared to uncut and partial-cut treatments. Clearcuts did not reduce habitat permeability for the low number of marked wood frogs that entered these treatments. Data from marked wood frogs also suggest that both density of conspeciﬁcs and habitat quality can inﬂuence habitat selection, and potentially dispersal of juvenile amphibians. The avoidance of clearcuts by juveniles of all study species suggests that this silvicultural technique may reduce both abundance and dispersal of many species, rather than just species where adults are known to be forest-dependent. Species may also be affected by partial as well as full canopy removal, and the retention of CWD may play a role in mitigating some of the effects of clearcutting.},

Despite the historical recognition that amphibians could play an important role in the movement of biomass and nutrients, very few studies have provided reliable estimates of abundance and density of amphibians to reveal their true importance. Here, we provide robust estimates of abundance and density of a dominant species, the Southern Redback Salamander (Plethodon serratus Grobman, 1944), in the oak forest ecosystem of the Ozark Highlands in Missouri. We then use the abundance and density estimates to calculate biomass and nutrient content of salamanders at our study sites in the Ozark forests. Salamanders at the Sinkin Experimental Forest comprise a large amount of protein, energy, and nutrients that greatly exceed estimates derived some 35 years ago in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Our estimates (7 300 –12 900 salamanders·ha−1) are 2–4 times greater than the values reported by Burton and Likens (1975a, Ecology, 56: 1068–1080; 1975b, Copeia, 1975: 541–546). Furthermore, we show that density estimates of other small plethodontid species reported in the literature are nearly an order of magnitude greater than that reported by Burton and Likens. We believe this indicates that previous results have underestimated the importance of salamander biomass, nutrient, and energy ﬂux, and their functional role in regulating invertebrates and carbon retention in forest ecosystems.},

We tested the functional redundancy of novel tree communities by verifying if six pairs of congeneric European and North American tree species bearing similar leaf litter traits resulted in similar ecological filters influencing the assembly of springtail (Collembola) communities at two sites. Litter biogeographic origin (native versus non-native) did not influence springtail community structure, but litter genus, which generally reflected trait differences, did. Our empirical evidence suggests that a functional trait approach may be indeed as relevant as, and complementary to, studying biogeographic origin to understand the ecological consequences of non-native tree species in soils of novel forest ecosystems.},

In boreal forests, managers are increasingly considering intensifying woody biomass removal for bioenergy, but associated functional eﬀects on soil fauna that use microhabitats associated with this biomass remain poorly understood. Two years after harvesting, we assessed the eﬀects of an increasing intensity gradient of biomass removal in a northeastern Ontario jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stand on the functional structure of Collembola and Oribatida communities, two abundant soil taxa. The gradient ranged from (1) uncut forest to (2) stem-only harvesting to intense biomass removal through (3) wholetree harvesting (stem, top and branches) with (4) stump removal and (5) additional removal of organic soil strata. Morphological and life-history response traits associated with hypothesized functions were measured to determine changes in the functional structure (species trait diversity and composition) of communities in response to the gradient and related environmental changes. We found that functional structure of communities of both taxa was overall signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by biomass removal through a compositional shift in species traits in comparison to uncut forest. Functional homogenization was observed for Oribatida communities with a loss of species that were surface-dwelling, larger, predominantly sexually reproducing and mostly micro-detritivorous. In contrast, Collembola communities were less aﬀected with only the most extreme treatment showing a more homogenized community than the uncut forest. These functional changes were mainly explained by fewer suitable microhabitats, characterized for example by a more stable microclimate as well as more abundant and diverse food resources, due to the disturbance of forest ﬂoor organic cover with harvesting. To improve sustainable management of boreal forests, long-term studies will be needed to assess if partial functional homogenization of soil mesofauna by intensive practices persists through time and may inﬂuence soil ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Woody biomass is increasingly harvested in Canadian boreal forests as a source of bioenergy. However, there is concern over the environmental sustainability of harvesting practices. Our study assessed how forest ﬂoor mesofauna communities responded to an increasing intensity gradient of biomass removal and soil disturbance in a jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forest in northeastern Ontario, and whether any modiﬁcation in community structure could be related to environmental change. Five experimental treatments were established that included a mature jack pine control stand (no recent harvesting) and harvesting of stem-only, whole-tree (stem, top and branches), whole-tree with stump removal and whole-tree with stump and forest ﬂoor (organic layer) removal. Two years after treatment application, we compared the structure of Collembola and Oribatida communities in moss, organic and mineral soil samples along this gradient. Despite both taxa showing somewhat contrasting responses, in general, each community had signiﬁcantly lower density and species richness (α-diversity) and more compositional dissimilarities in response to biomass removal compared to uncut mature stands. These diﬀerences were especially marked in the two most intense removal treatments (whole-tree harvesting with stump removal and that with the additional forest ﬂoor removal). We attributed this result to the major loss of surface-dwelling species after harvesting and along the biomass removal gradient, especially in Oribatida communities, likely due to the loss of favourable microhabitats provided by moss and woody debris. Environmental changes observed along the gradient, beyond the loss of these microhabitats, were driven by the removal of forest ﬂoor decreasing soil nutrient richness and acidity and increasing soil temperature. Forest ﬂoor mesofaunal communities were clearly modiﬁed by more intensive biomass removal practices as compared to stem-only and whole-tree biomass harvesting. Long-term studies will be needed to investigate to what extent these patterns vary through time in order to inform sustainable management of woody biomass removal in this ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Abstract   In North American boreal forests, woody biomass is increasingly becoming an attractive bioenergy feedstock as it represents a more renewable, and low carbon alternative to fossil fuel. However, concerns over the ecological sustainability of an intensification of biomass harvesting over the long term remain. We assessed the effects of a gradient of biomass removal established 20years ago in five jack pine (Pinus banksiana) stands across northeastern Ontario on the taxonomic and functional structure of ground-dwelling Collembola and Oribatida communities. Essential to soil functioning, these two major taxa of mesofauna are dependent on microhabitats and food supply such as fungi provided by woody debris. Three treatments were considered including stem-only harvesting, whole-tree harvesting (stem, tops and branches removed), and blading (whole-tree harvesting plus removal of stump and forest floor). Adjacent uncut mature (±90year-old) stands were considered as reference state conditions (i.e. the endpoint of stand development following stand replacing disturbance). Soil mesofauna were collected and environmental variables measured across all treatments. We identified species of both taxa and measured a suite of functional response traits such as body length and reproduction strategy. Compared to mature uncut forests, soil mesofaunal communities remained modified 20years after biomass harvesting, notably in the most intense practice (blading). Treatment effects were more evident in Oribatida communities both taxonomically (lower density, biomass, species diversity and shifted composition) and functionally (lower diversity and modified trait composition resulting from fewer surface-dwelling, fast-dispersing and micro-detritivorous species) than in Collembola communities. This taxa-specific response may reflect generally shorter lifespans, higher reproduction rates and faster dispersal of Collembola than Oribatida. Incomplete recovery of mesofauna was consistent with persistent modifications of soil environmental conditions in harvested plots, notably after blading. Modifications included a reduced organic cover (ground vegetation, mosses and woody debris) as well as lower organic soil thickness and moisture, which likely resulted in fewer suitable microhabitats for many species. Using complementary taxonomic and trait-based approaches to highlight the underlying mechanisms of mesofaunal responses, our study revealed that recovery is incomplete within 20years after intensive biomass removal in these boreal conifer-dominated stands, and is likely linked to stand development and associated processes. As a result, longer-term monitoring will be required to track mesofaunal community recovery through these later developmental stages.},

	abstract = {Abstract   Replacement of native deciduous forests by coniferous stands was a common consequence of former European afforestation policies. However, these changes have proven to lead to serious ecological problems. Therefore, re-establishing mixed forests with native tree species became an increasingly popular management strategy to fulfil the demands of multi-functional forestry. We report about changes in collembolan assemblages and microbial performances during conversion of pure coniferous stands to mixed forests. The study was carried out in the Black forest area (SW of Germany), where a gradient of conversion from pure spruce stands (S1) to equally mixed stands (spruce, beech, and fir) at S4, through two intermediate stages (S2 and S3) was selected. Results clearly indicated strong modifications of the collembolan communities with an enrichment of the assemblages over the course of the conversion process. Mean species richness increased by 47\% from S1 to S4 accompanied by diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson) higher at S4. Significantly different soil biota assemblages were found at each phase of the conversion process. Spatial turnover and nestedness contribute almost equally to the modification of assemblages from S1 to S2 while later on in the mixing process only spatial turnover was acting. Concomitantly, significant shifts in the functional structure of the collembolan assemblages were depicted, deep-dwelling collembolan (euedaphic) being, surprisingly, the most responsive group. In contrast, neither microbial nor coarse environmental parameters were influenced by the factor “conversion phase”. We suggest that stimulation of Collembolan communities after the mixing process was mainly due to the input of more suitable food sources and/or microhabitat increases. Our findings underline the crucial role of aboveground processes on the belowground system, with the intensity and scheme of the mixing-process as important factors to consider when aiming at soil biodiversity improvement in forest systems.},

Occupancy models have emerged as a popular approach for inferring species occurrence because they account for problems associated with imperfect detection in field surveys. Current models, however, are limited because they assume ­covariates are independent (i.e., indirect effects do not occur). Here, we combined structural equation and occupancy models to investigate complex influences on species occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection. These two methods are inherently compatible because they both provide means to make inference on latent or unobserved quantities based on observed data. Our models evaluated the direct and indirect roles of cattle grazing, water chemistry, vegetation, nonnative fishes, and pond permanence on the ­occurrence of six pond-breeding amphibians, two of which are threatened: the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and the California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii). While cattle had strong effects on pond vegetation and water chemistry, their overall effects on amphibian occurrence were small compared to the consistently negative effects of nonnative fish. Fish strongly reduced occurrence probabilities for four of five native amphibians, including both species of conservation concern. These results could help to identify drivers of amphibian declines and to prioritize strategies for amphibian conservation. More generally, this approach facilitates a more mechanistic representation of ideas about the causes of species distributions in space and time. As shown here, occupancy modeling and structural equation modeling are readily combined, and bring rich sets of techniques that may provide unique theoretical and applied insights into basic ecological questions.},

This mismatch may cause catastrophic losses of key forest ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, habitat provisioning, and forest products. In response, forest managers and researchers are developing a suite of climate-adaptive strategies designed to sustain forest diversity and function. Among these, forest assisted migration (FAM) involves the movement of planting stock from source populations to locations either within or beyond their current ranges. The goal is to establish forests that can survive in today's climate and expected to thrive in future conditions, thereby sustaining ecosystem good and services. Because FAM is still in its infancy, implementation is limited by many uncertainties. Climatically derived seed sourcing is needed to ensure that planting stock possesses the ecophysiological amplitude to withstand both current and future climatic conditions at the destination site. Additionally, more knowledge about the impacts of local herbivores and intraspecific competition are needed because these drivers will co-regulate seedling success along with climate. Practically, these uncertainties must be addressed to instill in managers sufficient confidence that FAM investments will fulfill long-term management and societal goals relative to other silvicultural approaches. The Desired REgeneration through Assisted Migration (DREAM) framework is an international collaboration that uses basic and applied research to reduce these uncertainties and derive climate-informed planting approaches. DREAM is self-reinforcing in that each step in the process informs and strengthens subsequent phases. Namely, it sources seed in a climatically informed manner, experimentally tests this sourced stock to probe for physiological maladaptation under controlled settings, grows the stock in the field under a range of silvicultural scenarios, and finally forecasts long-term outcomes using models parameterized from the controlled- and field-tests. In this paper, we describe the DREAM framework and illustrate aspects of its implementation drawing from two experimental sites: one in Québec, Canada and one in Wisconsin, USA. Moreover, we place the DREAM study into the broader FAM context by briefly contrasting it with other operational examples throughout North America. Knowledge gained from this research-management collaboration will expand current reforestation paradigms to include future climate-adaptive ones that aim to use the right seed, planted in the right places, under the right conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract   Terrestrial salamander abundance in North American forests is closely associated with forest characteristics, and salamander populations typically decline following timber removal. However, salamander responses to timber harvest vary considerably from one study to the next – some studies have shown limited or no effects whereas others have found harvest-related declines of up to 95\%. To estimate overall effect sizes of timber harvest on salamander populations and to examine factors that contribute to variation in salamander responses to harvest, we carried out a meta-analysis of published studies of the effects of timber harvesting on terrestrial salamander abundance. Based on 108 salamander species/treatment combinations from 24 studies, we found mean harvest-related declines ranged from 29\% (95\% CI=−2\% to 51\%) for long-term responses to partial canopy removal to 62\% (95\% CI=29\% to 80\%) for short-term responses to clearcutting. Multivariate mixed models suggested that clearcutting had a modestly greater impact on salamander populations than partial harvest and that decreases following harvest were more pronounced at sites with warmer summer high temperatures. In addition, active sampling of salamanders (e.g., surface counts) led to greater apparent effects of timber harvest than passive sampling (e.g., cover boards or pitfall traps), suggesting that sampling methodology influenced the perceived effects of harvest. In the studies evaluated, salamander numbers almost always declined following timber removal, but salamanders were never extirpated and populations typically increased as forests regenerated.},

Although the impact of clear-cutting has received much attention, the widely-used practice of selective logging (in which individual trees or small groups of trees are removed leaving gaps in the forest canopy) has been incompletely studied. We examined the effects of such logging on the distributions of individual redback salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, in a mixed deciduous forest that had been harvested 1 yr earlier. Salamander densities and distributions were assessed using thorough searches of leaf litter and cover objects in quadrats along transects which passed from gaps into the surrounding forest. Comparisons were made between quadrats in three location categories: inside the gaps, along gap edges, and within the forest. We found much variation in salamander numbers among transects, but detected no significant differences in the densities of salamanders among the three location categories. Similarly, salamanders did not show different degrees of within-quadrat grouping among the location categories. These results suggest that the newly formed gaps produced by selective logging did not strongly affect the distributions of P. cinereus in the first year following harvest.},

	doi = {10.1111/oik.03677},
	abstract = {Plant–soil interactions are increasingly recognized to play a major role in terrestrial ecosystems functioning. However, few studies to date have focused on slow dynamic ecosystems such as forests. As they are vertically stratified by multiple vegetation strata, canopy tree removal by thinning operations could alter forest plant community through tree canopy opening. Very little is known about cascading effects on soil biodiversity.

We conducted a large-scale, multi-site assessment of collembolan assemblage response to long-term canopy tree removal in sessile oak Quercus petraea temperate forests. A total of 33 experimental plots were studied covering a large gradient of canopy tree basal area, stand age and local abiotic contexts.

Collembolan abundance strongly declined with canopy tree removal in early forest successional stage and this was mediated by negative effect of understory plant community composition changes, i.e. shift from moss and forb to tree seedling, fern, shrub and grass species. Negative effect of this composition shift on collembolan species richness was largely offset by positive effect of the increase in understory plant species richness. This gives support to both the plant mass-ratio and functional diversity hypotheses. Collembolan functional groups had contrasting response patterns, which were mediated by different ecological factors. Epedaphic (r-strategist) abundance and species richness increased with canopy tree removal in relation with the increase in understory plant species richness. In contrast, euedaphic (K-strategist) abundance and species richness declined with canopy tree removal in early forest successional stage in relation with changes in understory plant community composition and species richness, as well as microclimatic conditions.

Overall, our study provides experimental evidence that forest plant community can be a strong driver of collembolan assemblages. It also emphasizes the role of trees as foundation species of forest ecosystems that can shape soil biodiversity through their regulation of understory plant community and ecosystem abiotic conditions.},

	doi = {10.1111/2041-210x.13858},
	abstract = {Large-scale, long-term biodiversity monitoring is essential to conservation, land management and identifying threats to biodiversity. However, multispecies surveys are prone to various types of observation error, including false-positive/false-negative detection and misclassification, where a species is thought to have been encountered but not correctly identified. Previous methods assume an imperfect classifier produces species-level classifications, but in practice, particularly with human observers, we may end up with extraspecific classifications including ‘unknown’, morphospecies designations and taxonomic identifications coarser than species. Disregarding these types of species misclassification in biodiversity monitoring datasets can bias estimates of ecologically important quantities such as demographic rates, occurrence and species richness. Here we present a joint classification-occupancy model that accounts for species non-detection and misclassification. Our framework accommodates extinction and colonization dynamics, allows for additional uncertain ‘morphospecies’ designations and makes use of individual specimens with known species identities in a semi-supervised setting. We compare the performance of our model to a classification-only model that discards information about occupancy and encounter rate. We illustrate our model with an empirical case study of the carabid beetle (Carabidae) community at the National Ecological Observatory Network Niwot Ridge Mountain Research Station, near Boulder, CO, USA. We also use simulations to evaluate model performance through validation metrics where varying fractions of the data are confirmed. The model supported imperfect classifier accuracy and favoured certain true species classifications strongly for some morphospecies. The model outperformed (e.g. precision) the reduced model that discarded occupancy information, and these differences were most pronounced for abundant species. Spatial and temporal dynamics from modelled occupancy and encounter rates may inform species misclassification probability, but this idea has not yet been tested. Our statistical framework explores this opportunity, and can be applied to datasets with imperfect species detection and classification, limited verification data and non-species classifications.},

The biomass of the aboveground vegetation (trees, saplings, understory), litter and woody debris (coarse, small, fine), as well as the roots (diameter ≤ 1.5 cm) was evaluated. Additionally, soil C pools up to a depth of 35 cm of the mineral soil were assessed. Total ecosystem C stocks were influenced by the overstory treatments reflecting harvest intensities. Although the belowground C pools were major contributors to total ecosystem C stocks, silvicultural treatments only influenced forest floor and aboveground C stocks.

	abstract = {Salamanders represent exceptional indicators for understanding environmental change and forest degradation. Coverboards, a type of artificial cover object, have become a popular tool for censusing salamanders given their low cost of installation and lack of danger to the environment and animals. Previous work has suggested that a variety of factors including wood type, coverboard size and thickness, and array design may impact coverboard usage by salamanders, potentially confounding results. Therefore, when comparing salamander counts across studies, or even within multi-year studies, it is necessary to standardize study designs. We assessed how coverboard age and the coverboard aging process affects coverboard usage by red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), using arrays composed of boards with three different ages (zero, one, and five-year old boards) in Palmer, Massachusetts from 2017–2019. We found that there was no difference in salamander preference for zero- or one-year old boards, but there was a strong preference for five-year old boards. We also found that board aging does not strongly impact preference. Factors such as snout-vent length and age class were not significantly correlated with board age. For multi-year studies greater than two years, we recommend either replacing boards every 2–3 years before they become significantly more attractive to salamanders or weathering boards for greater than two years prior to deploying them. Ensuring comparable study designs will likely eliminate many of the conflicting results that are found in coverboard literature and we echo many workers who call for standardization.},

	abstract = {Abstract   Forest fragmentation by management activities has been implicated in the decline of forest biodiversity. Even though boreal ecosystems are generally deemed quite resilient to disturbance effects, high contemporary levels of disturbance might push forest-interior species toward decline or extinction. In this study, we examined beetle communities in forest patches of different sizes, including clearcuts, residual postharvest patches from 0.03 to 50ha in size, and large mature forest tracts ({\textgreater}1000ha). Overall, community structure follows a gradient between clearcuts and large mature forest tracts, even if patch size effects were more difficult to detect among patches {\textgreater}2.5ha. Beetles were most abundant in clearcuts, and species richness was highest in small tree groups (0.03–0.05ha). The effects of fragmentation were strongly conditioned by beetle feeding habits. Predators and xylophagous beetles were mostly associated with clearcuts or smaller patches (i.e., small tree groups or large tree groups [0.3–0.5ha]), whereas fungivorous beetles were associated with forest-interior habitats. Although many forest-interior species were still present in relatively small patches 1–5years after harvesting, negative effects of habitat fragmentation on these species might increase in the long-term.},

Although the two species are closely related, P. r. shenandoah grows to a longer body length and has a broader head. All age classes of P. r. Shenandoah emigrate out of the talus and are found within 3 m of the talus edge, but only adults which are as large as or larger than the largest P. cinereus are able to survive farther than about 3 m from the talus. This distribution is not explained by a tendency for large adults to wander more than juveniles. The large P. r. Shenandoah in the soil take prey that are significantly larger than prey taken by cohabiting P. cinereus, indicating that food may be the limited resource for which competition occurs. Both species are euryphagic and prey upon the same taxa of small animals. Food is periodically limited in availability, but not in abundance. Following a rain, salamanders forage freely and consume a large quantity of prey, based on stomach contents, but prey become increasingly unavailable as the soil and leaf litter dry and the salamanders are restricted to isolated pockets of moisture. Stomachs remain virtually empty until the next rain, at which time they are full again indicating that the abundance of prey is not greatly affected by the intervening dryness. Food may periodically become a limited resource during long dry seasons and as such may affect the survival of the salamanders or their ability to produce eggs.},

These may include ultraviolet radiation, predation, habitat modification, environmental acidity and toxicants, diseases, changes in climate or weather patterns, and interactions among these factors. Understanding the extent of the problem and its nature requires an understanding of how local factors affect the dynamics of local populations. Hypotheses about population behavior must be tested against appropriate null hypotheses. We generated null hypotheses for the behavior of amphibian populations using a model, and we used them to test hypotheses about the behavior of 85 time series taken from the literature. Our results suggest that most amphibian populations should decrease more often than they increase, due to highly variable recruitment and less variable adult mortality. During the period covered by our data (1951–1997), more amphibian populations decreased than our model predicted. However, there was no indication that the proportion of populations decreasing changed over time. In addition, our review of the literature suggests that many if not most amphibians exist in metapopulations. Understanding the dynamics of amphibian populations will require an integration of studies on and within local populations and at the metapopulation level.},

We investigated the role of Ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii ) in regulating invertebrate numbers and leaf litter retention in a northern California forest. Our objective was to examine how salamander predation on invertebrates affects leaf litter retention and the amount available for soil-building and carbon capture at the litter-soil interface. We used field enclosures to quantify the effects of Ensatina on invertebrates and litter retention over two wet seasons, using moisture as a covariate. In the first year Ensatina reduced Coleoptera (beetles) and Diptera (flies) larvae .2 mm, adult Coleoptera, Collembola (springtails), and Formicidae (ants), and increased Oribatid mites, larvae ,2 mm (Diptera and Coleoptera), Diplopoda (millipedes), and Aranaea (spiders) ,2 mm by reducing their competitors and predators. A single Ensatina in a 1.5m2 enclosure increased litter retention by 13.3\% 6 3.6\% (mean 6 SE) compared to controls, facilitating the capture of 200 kg/ha of carbon. At a similar density range-wide this would equate to 72.3 metric tons/yr of carbon in one season potentially sequestered in forest soil rather than entering the atmosphere. In the second year invertebrate densities doubled in response to early rains such that while salamanders reduced the numbers of the same taxa, effect sizes were lower compared to year one, producing biological effects that failed to achieve statistical significance. However, three taxa did significantly increase in year two (Annelida [worms], Psocoptera [barklice], and Chelonethida [pseudoscorpions]). Litter retention in year two was greater on treatment plots by 5.6\% 6 4.6\%; however, high variability across plots precluded statistical significance. Ensatina suppressed some invertebrate taxa, released others, increased leaf litter retention, and facilitated greater carbon capture in both years; however, the strength of the effects were modulated by the bottom-up effects of the timing and amount of precipitation in year two.},

The feeding behavior and nutrient assimilation of a terrestrial salamander, Eastern Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus (Green, 1818)), was surveyed along a gradient of forest biogeochemistry. Recent studies have documented populations of these salamanders in forests with low-pH soils that were long thought to be fatal. One mechanism that may enable P. cinereus to tolerate acid-impaired habitats is its generalist life history. We sampled diet, invertebrate prey abundance, and tissue composition of P. cinereus from sites that range in calcium availability and soil pH in northern forests of North America. We found that P. cinereus consistently exhibited a generalist feeding strategy, having diverse diets closely representing resource availability. Prey abundances were unrelated to the biogeochemical gradient (excluding gastropods), indicating relatively intact food webs. Although P. cinereus at the two most acid-impaired sites consumed more prey, overall trophic strategies were consistent across the gradient. Salamander tissue composition was unrelated to variation in forest biogeochemistry, although manganese levels were elevated in the most acid-impaired forests. We suggest that a generalist feeding strategy, combined with diverse and compositionally stable food webs, facilitates tolerance by this abundant predator of the challenges imposed by acid-impaired habitats.},

	abstract = {Intraguild predation in structurally complex habitats is thought to weaken trophic cascades and increase food web stability. However, many predators commonly found in leaf litter become restricted to simple microhabitat beneath rocks and logs during periods between rains. It is within this structurally simple microhabitat that some predators defend rich prey resources and are likely to interact strongly as the surrounding forest becomes too dry to forage broadly in space. We conducted a 4-y press experiment where we removed focal predators from unfenced field plots. To evaluate the effects of predators on one another we removed either salamanders or centipedes from beneath artificially placed cover objects and compared abundances of these and other intraguild predators to those in non-removal controls. We predicted that salamanders and centipedes would have strong negative effects on each other and on carabid beetles and spiders. We removed a total of 1288 salamanders and 1056 centipedes over 98 sampling dates. In salamander removal plots spider abundance increased by 34\%, and carabid beetles decreased by 15\% relative to the control. In centipede removal plots salamanders increased by 18\% and carabid beetles increased by 29\%, but spider abundance decreased by 15\%. Interaction strengths were strongest in the drier summer months when territorial predators were confined in spatially fixed microhabitats. It is during these periods that predators may strongly regulate the abundances of guild members. In territorial species that defend areas beneath natural cover, the effect of intraguild predators may be an important mechanism that regulates distribution and abundance of forest floor predators.},

Despite the recognition that salamanders have the potential to strongly affect ecosystem function through both direct and indirect pathways, little is known regarding the nature of interactions between small vertebrates and the large, predatory arthropods with which they share both microhabitat and prey. Our study was designed to explore interactions between Eastern Red-backed Salamanders, Plethodon cinereus, and spiders in the genus Wadotes in an eastern North American temperate forest ecosystem. We were particularly interested in teasing apart behaviors such as territoriality and intraguild predation in an attempt to determine specifically which interaction is most likely responsible for the observed negative relationship between salamander and spider abundance at our field site. Field data indicate that P. cinereus and large syntopic spiders exhibit negative spatial associations in the microhabitat beneath cover objects, a possible indication of interspecific territoriality. In our laboratory experiments, resident salamanders displayed agonistic postures similarly toward both intruding conspecifics and spiders, suggesting that salamanders may perceive large intruding spiders as competitors. Finally, we observed no injuries to individual P. cinereus or adult spiders even though occasional chases and bites by both were recorded during the behavioral trials. We found no evidence that adults or juveniles of P. cinereus were envenomated by adult Wadotes spp., and there were no instances of intraguild predation in this study. Multiple lines of evidence from this study, and others, suggest that the primary interaction between individuals of P. cinereus and large spiders is competitive in nature rather than predatory. We suggest that the cost associated with intraguild predation on salamanders with noxious skin secretions may preclude them from being preyed upon by spiders.},

	abstract = {Understanding the role of species interactions as regulatory mechanisms for ecosystem processes presents a challenge to ecologists working in systems with high species diversity and habitat complexity. Recent studies suggest that interactions among intraguild predators, such as terrestrial salamanders and large arthropods, might be important for the regulation of detritivores, fungivores, and perhaps detritus within terrestrial webs. A key prediction is that interactions among predators weaken trophic cascades. Our research examined this prediction by removing predators for 4 yr from unfenced field plots to investigate the effects on litter arthropods, the microbial community, and rates of leaf litter decomposition. We manipulated predator abundance in three treatments (salamander removal, centipede removal, and multiple predator removal) compared to a control in which no predators were removed. Despite difficulties in suppressing centipede numbers, we observed increases in salamanders, millipedes, isopods, slugs, numbers of ant colonies, and gamasid mites in the centipede removal plots. Additionally, several phospholipid fatty acid markers for bacteria were suppressed in plots where salamanders were most abundant. Finally, we detected treatment effects on the rate of litter disappearance from leaf bags in our field plots: those with the most salamanders had the lowest levels of litter decomposition. Overall, we found some evidence for top-down effects of predators in a temperate forest-floor web. Our study is one of few that have employed an unfenced field design and the only study examining the effects of salamanders on forest soil microbes. The results contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating that territorial predators, such as terrestrial salamanders, can be strong regulators of species composition at lower trophic levels in a system that is commonly thought to be regulated primarily through bottom-up effects of organic matter supply.},

Predators can affect ecosystem functions through a combination of top-down trophic cascades and bottom-up effects on nutrient dynamics. As the most abundant vertebrate predator in many eastern US forests, woodland salamanders (Plethodon spp.) likely affect ecosystems functions. We examined the effects of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) on a variety of forest ecosystem functions using a combined approach of large-scale salamander removals (314-m2 plots) and small-scale enclosures (2 m2) where we explicitly manipulated salamander density (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 m22). In these experiments, we measured the rates of litter and wood decomposition, potential nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates, acorn germination, and foliar insect damage on red oak seedlings. Across both experimental venues, we found no significant effect of red-backed salamanders on any of the ecosystem functions. We also found no effect of salamanders on intraguild predator abundance (carabid beetles, centipedes, spiders). Our study adds to the already conflicting evidence on effects of red-backed salamander and other amphibians on terrestrial ecosystem functions. It appears likely that the impact of terrestrial amphibians on ecosystem functions is context dependent. Future research would benefit from explicitly examining terrestrial amphibian effects on ecosystem functions under a variety of environmental conditions and in different forest types.},

Stomach analysis confirmed that salamanders were euryphagic, but they consumed mo herbivores than detritivores or predators.

Despite the historical recognition that amphibians could play an important role in the movement of biomass and nutrients, very few studies have provided reliable estimates of abundance and density of amphibians to reveal their true importance. Here, we provide robust estimates of abundance and density of a dominant species, the Southern Redback Salamander (Plethodon serratus Grobman, 1944), in the oak forest ecosystem of the Ozark Highlands in Missouri. We then use the abundance and density estimates to calculate biomass and nutrient content of salamanders at our study sites in the Ozark forests. Salamanders at the Sinkin Experimental Forest comprise a large amount of protein, energy, and nutrients that greatly exceed estimates derived some 35 years ago in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Our estimates (7 300 –12 900 salamanders·ha−1) are 2–4 times greater than the values reported by Burton and Likens (1975a, Ecology, 56: 1068–1080; 1975b, Copeia, 1975: 541–546). Furthermore, we show that density estimates of other small plethodontid species reported in the literature are nearly an order of magnitude greater than that reported by Burton and Likens. We believe this indicates that previous results have underestimated the importance of salamander biomass, nutrient, and energy ﬂux, and their functional role in regulating invertebrates and carbon retention in forest ecosystems.},

I tested this hypothesis during a 6-yr study of the effects of the Eastern Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus) on the invertebrate community of a forest site in northeast Ohio. Salamander surface density, invertebrate abundance, and community composition were monitored within 30 open, circular plots. Variation in plot occupancy by P. cinereus was achieved by supplying plots with differing amounts of artiﬁcial cover (0, 1, or 4 ceramic tiles) that served as refuges for the salamanders. Salamander plot occupancy, invertebrate density, leaf litter mass, and leaf litter moisture were quantiﬁed each spring and fall from 2003 through 2008. Statistically signiﬁcant effects of salamander plot-occupancy on invertebrate densities were found for several taxa of mesofauna, including several Collembola taxa, oribatid mites, pseudoscorpions, and psocoptera. The strength and direction of salamander effects varied among taxa and included negative, positive, and no effects on invertebrate densities. The magnitude and sign of salamander effects on invertebrate densities were predicted by seasonal and interannual variation in leaf litter mass and, to a lesser extent, litter moisture content. Salamander effects decreased with increasing litter mass and were more often negative when litter mass was high, whereas positive effects on invertebrate densities were more likely when litter mass was low. For several taxa, the positive effect of P. cinereus also increased with litter moisture. I propose two mechanistic hypotheses for these dynamics that integrate behavioral ecology of salamander prey selection and territorial defense with variation in litter mass and litter moisture.},

We tested the hypothesis that the top–down effects of P. cinereus are influenced by the species composition of invertebrates of the forest-floor. In a month-long microcosm experiment, we compared salamander effects on invertebrate species composition in leaf-litter from two sites that differed in species and size composition of invertebrate detritivores (an urban forest site at which isopods and millipedes were numerous and a rural forest site at which Collembola were the most numerous detritivores, but isopods and millipedes were few). Our results were consistent with our initial hypothesis. The presence of salamanders within microcosms was associated with decreased densities of oribatid mites, pseudoscorpions, isopods and millipedes in comparison to salamander-absent controls, but negative effects of salamanders on isopods and millipedes were most strongly expressed within urban litter microcosms. Salamanders were also associated with a positive, indirect effect, i.e., an increase in density of podomorphic Collembola in comparison to salamander-absent controls, but within urban litter exclusively. Our results suggested that plethodontid salamanders exerted positive, indirect effects through consumption of an intermediate predator, i.e., pseudoscorpions, and macroinvertebrate competitors, i.e., isopods and millipedes, of podomorphic Collembola. We hypothesize that differences in salamander-mediated dynamics between the two litter sources resulted from prey selection by P. cinereus based on differences in prey size and abundance between the rural and urban forest litter.},

Therefore, habitat disturbances that alter temperature regimes may interact with physiological processes to affect energy budgets of salamanders or constrain surface activity and possibly lead to changes in population-level parameters. We hypothesized that warmer surface temperatures following harvesting of canopy trees could cause surface-active salamanders to expend more energy for metabolism, potentially leaving a smaller proportion of the energy budget available for reproduction or storage. From 2006 to 2008, we quantified temperature regimes of salamander refugia in a field experiment replicated at 4 sites that included plots subjected to a timber harvest and plots not manipulated during this time period. At each site, we quantified temperature regimes in regenerating forest stands which, approximately 10 years earlier, experienced a range of harvest intensity from shelterwood to silvicultural clearcut. Further, we compared energetic parameters including 1) calories required to maintain homeostasis across an active season, 2) abundance of available potential energy (i.e., invertebrate prey), and 3) a measure of growth and storage (i.e., body condition index) among silvicultural treatments for surface-active salamanders. For surface-active eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), mean calories required for maintenance were approxi- mately 33\% greater in recently harvested forest compared to unharvested controls, but body condition was inconsistent among treatments, and invertebrate abundances were similar among treatments but differed by study site. In contrast, we did not detect a treatment effect in any energetic metric 8-14 growing seasons after harvesting. Given that surface-active salamanders in recently harvested forest may be forced to restrain behaviors associated with foraging and mating or trade-off growth or reproduction for increased basic maintenance costs, energetics may be an important but overlooked short-term contributor to observed changes in abundances, reproductive demography, or surface activities after timber harvesting. Managing for both the rapid recovery of understory vegetation and retention of large stumps and logs may help mitigate warming of microclimate for salamanders and should be considered further. 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

Both soil compaction and organic matter removal re- duced the density of soil mesofauna. Stem-only harvesting reduced total mesofauna densities by 20\% relative to uncut forest values. A combination of whole-tree harvest and forest floor removal with heavy soil compaction significantly reduced total soil mesofauna densities by 93\% relative to the uncut forest control. Removal of the forest floor repre- sents a substantial loss of habitat for most soil mesofauna. The forest floor apparently buffered the mineral soil by lim- iting both the impact of soil compaction and fluctuations in soil temperature and moisture. The relative abundance of Prostigmata and Mesostigmata increased with treatment severity, whereas that of Oribatida decreased. Species richness of the oribatid mite fauna was reduced as the severity of treatments increased. The number of rare oribatid species (those representing {\textless}1\% of the total oribatid mite sample) decreased by 40\% or more relative to the uncut forest con- trol. Evenness also decreased as treatment severity increased. Oppiella nova and Suctobelbella sp. near acutidens were the dominant oribatid species in both the forest floor and mineral soil, regardless of treatment.

Removal of harvesting residues had negative effects on the abundances of animals at higher trophic positions and on more mobile animals. Predators such as gamasid mites, spiders and staphyliniid and cantharid beetles decreased by 30–50\% after WTH at both sites. Microbidetritivorous dipterans and fungivorous Collembola decreased at the pine site, but not at the more productive spruce site. Enchytraeids and nematodes were usually not affected by WTH. No differences in fungal and bacterial biomass were found. The removal of organic matter had fairly long-term, of the order of decades, effects on the soil food web. The effects were quantitative rather than qualitative. No functional groups disappeared after WTH. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that soil food webs are entirely donor-controlled. The more pronounced effects of WTH at higher trophic positions indicates that the major interactions in the food webs we have studied are reciprocal, i.e., that consumers to some degree control the density of their resources.},

In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and subcontinental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worstcase scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth.},

	doi = {10.1038/nature08649},
	abstract = {In the event of climate change, species have to move if they are to remain in an area with the same average temperature: their chances of survival therefore depend on the ability to keep pace with a moving climate as well as on the extent of change in temperature and other climate factors. To put this pressure on species into context, a novel index designed to quantify climate change in the coming century has been developed. Its value gives the local velocity along the Earth's surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and is derived from temperature gradients scaled by distance (°C per km) and time (°C per year). The index provides a quantitative view of the role of topography in buffering climate change as it would affect plants and animals: on the IPCC's A1B emission scenario the index has a global mean of 0.42 km per year, compared to extremes of 0.08 and 1.26 km per year for mountains forest biomes and flooded grasslands, respectively. Climate change velocity, it turns out, is large relative to species migration speeds and the sizes of protected habitats. The data suggest that, in some ecosystems, helping species to relocate more rapidly via habitat corridors or new reserves could be an important contribution to conservation. As the climate changes, species will have to move if they are to remain in an area with the same average temperature. Here, this required movement — termed the velocity of temperature change — is quantified. The results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change and suggest that montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century. The ranges of plants and animals are moving in response to recent changes in climate1. As temperatures rise, ecosystems with ‘nowhere to go’, such as mountains, are considered to be more threatened2,3. However, species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climate’s ultimate persistence4,5. Here we present a new index of the velocity of temperature change (km yr-1), derived from spatial gradients (°Ckm-1) and multimodel ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase (°Cyr-1) in the twenty-first century. This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earth’s surface needed to maintain constant temperatures, and has a global mean of 0.42kmyr-1 (A1B emission scenario). Owing to topographic effects, the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests (0.08kmyr-1), temperate coniferous forest, and montane grasslands. Velocities are highest in flooded grasslands (1.26kmyr-1), mangroves and deserts. High velocities suggest that the climates of only 8\% of global protected areas have residence times exceeding 100years. Small protected areas exacerbate the problem in Mediterranean-type and temperate coniferous forest biomes. Large protected areas may mitigate the problem in desert biomes. These results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change. Montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century. Elsewhere, reduced emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas6, or efforts to increase species movement may be necessary7.},

We showed that the different forest types differed significantly i n terms of their carabid assemblages. The managed f orest had the most distinct assemblage, with a lower spec ies richness and abundance than the other two fores t types.

	abstract = {We compared pitfall catches from four types of mature lodgepole pine—white spruce forest with those from five age classes of young forest regenerating subsequent to clear-cutting. Ground beetles were most abundant in the youngest sites (1–2 years since cutting) and in the mature stands on moist soil. Species richness was higher in regenerating sites than in mature forest. Cluster analysis grouped the ground-beetle fauna according to forest age and forest type, suggesting that there is a general pattern of recovery after logging. Responses of common species to forest cutting fell into three groups: (1) forest generalists (2 species) were not dramatically affected, (2) species of open habitat (27 species) appeared and/or increased in abundance, and (3) mature forest species (10 species) disappeared or decreased in abundance. Populations of many mature forest species appear to recover following logging, but several specialists did not recolonize even the oldest regenerating stands. Furthermore, fragmentation and creation of large areas of relatively homogeneous young forest stages through logging may have detrimental long-term effects even on the more abundant forest generalists. We must better understand subtle variations in habitat in order to maintain invertebrate diversity while harvesting the boreal forest.



Nosotros comparamos la captura de carabidos (Coleoptera: Carabidae), utilizando trampas de suelo, en cuatro tipos de bosques maduros de pino (Pinus contorta)—abeto blanco (Picea glauca), con aquella de cinco clases de bosques jovenes en regeneracion despues de tala indiscriminada. La abundancia de carabidos fue mayor en los sitios jovenes (1–2 anos despues de la tala), y en rodales maduros con suelo humedo. La riqueza de especies fue mayor en los sitios en regeneracion que en los bosques maduros. Analisis de agrupamiento (cluster analysis) separo la fauna de carabidos de acuerdo a la edad y al tipo de bosque, sugiriendo que despues de la tala existe un patron general de recuperacion. Las respuestas a la tala de especies comunes del bosque recayeron en tres grupos: (1) generalistas del bosque (2 especies) no fueron notablemente afectadas, (2) especies de habitats abiertos (27 especies) aparacieron y/o incrementaron en abundancia y (3) especies de bosques maduros (10 especies) desaparecieron o incrementaron en abundancia. Las poblaciones de muchas especies de bosques maduros parecen recuperarse despues de la tala, pero varias especialistas ni siquiera recolonizaron los rodales mas antiguos en regeneracion. Mas aun, la fragmentacion y creacion de extensas areas de bosques jovenes relativamente homogeneas a causa de la tala puede tener efectos adversos a largo plazo, aun para las especies generalistas mas abundantes del bosque.

Carabids are frequentlyused to indicate habitat alteration. They have been used in grasslands andboreal forests where species number and/or abundances have been noted to changealong a habitat disturbance gradient. A common trend is that large, poorlydispersing specialist species decrease with increased disturbance while smallgeneralist species with good dispersal ability increase. Some species are notaffected by moderate disturbance. There is, however, not enough research todetermine how suitable carabids are for biodiversity studies, or how well theyrepresent the response of other species.

	abstract = {Abstract   Amphibians have declined dramatically in many areas of the world. These declines seem to have worsened over the past 25 years and amphibians are now more threatened than either mammals or birds, though comparisons with other taxa are confounded by a shortage of reliable data. Research into amphibian declines has focused on: (1) documentation at the landscape or population level; and (2) observational and experimental work on potential causes of declines. Although loss of habitat is known to have impacted amphibians for decades, recent research has focused on the effects of environmental contaminants, UV-B irradiation, emerging diseases, the introduction of alien species, direct exploitation, and climate change. Such factors may interact with each other, but high levels of mortality do not necessarily lead to population declines. Major challenges remain in extrapolating from experimental data to population level effects, and in developing methodologies that will provide unbiased descriptions of amphibian population dynamics. Although amphibians have been widely advocated as good biological indicators, there is little evidence to suggest that they are more effective than other taxa as surrogate measures of biodiversity or habitat quality. As many of the threats facing amphibians are extremely difficult to neutralize in the short- to medium-term, the chances of ameliorating – let alone reversing – amphibian declines seem very poor.},

Our studies demonstrate that life stages related to oviposition and larval performance in the aquatic stage are sometimes affected positively by clearcutting, whereas effects on juvenile and adult terrestrial stages are mostly negative. Partial harvest treatments produced both positive and weaker negative responses than clearcut treatments.

Therefore, climate change adaptation strategies, such as assisted migration, have gained attention since 2007. Effective implementation of assisted migration can only occur if target transfer guidelines are developed because our current seed transfer guidelines, established to guide the movement of plant materials, lack inherent spatial and temporal dynamics associated with climate change. This limitation restrains reforestation practitioners from making decisions about assisted migration. Lack of operating procedures, uncertainties about future climate conditions, risks associated with moving plants outside their current ranges, and existing policies have hampered formal actions in forest management and conservation.

However, there is a lack of on-the-ground forest adaptation research to indicate what adaptation measures or tactics might be effective in preparing forest ecosystems to deal with climate change. Natural resource managers in many areas are also challenged by scant locally or regionally relevant information on climate projections and potential impacts. The Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) project was designed to respond to these barriers to operationalizing climate adaptation strategies by providing a multiregion network of replicated operational-scale research sites testing ecosystem-specific climate change adaptation treatments across a gradient of adaptive approaches, and introducing conceptual tools and processes to integrate climate change considerations into management and silvicultural decisionmaking. Here we present the framework of the ASCC project, highlight the implementation process at two of the study sites, and discuss the contributions of this collaborative science-management partnership.Management and Policy Implications The shortage of scientifically robust, replicated, operational-scale research on forest adaptation to climate change has left forest and natural resource managers with little information on and few examples of on-the-ground adaptation approaches that could work for their forest ecosystems. The Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) project is establishing a national network of long-term silvicultural research sites across multiple regions and a diversity of forest types to test a range of adaptation approaches and to provide managers with the tangible demonstrations needed to inform climate-adaptive decisionmaking in their forest management. Furthermore, the ASCC project provides managers and scientists with training on integrating climate change considerations into planning processes and identifying locally appropriate adaptation approaches and tactics. The main goals of the ASCC project ultimately serve to advance understanding within the forest management community of how management can foster adaptive responses to the impacts of uncertain climate futures. The science-management partnerships built through this project help inform the relevance of the research, as well as advance communication on climate change adaptation at a national scale.},

Though the growth rate of global CO2 emissions has slowed and many countries have strengthened their emissions targets, current mid-century net-zero goals are insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures. The primary barriers to the achievement of a 1.5°C-compatible pathway are not geophysical, but rather reflect inertia in our political and technological systems. Both political and corporate leadership are needed to overcome this inertia, supported by increased societal recognition of the need for system-level and individual lifestyle changes. The available evidence does not yet indicate that the world has seriously committed to achieving the 1.5°C goal.},

	abstract = {Regions and localities may lose many species to extinction under rapid climate change and may gain other species that colonize from nearby warmer environments. Here, it is argued that warming-induced species losses will generally exceed gains and there will be more net declines than net increases in plant community richness. Declines in richness are especially likely in water-limited climates where intensifying aridity will increasingly exceed plant tolerances, but also in colder temperature-limited climates where steep climatic gradients are lacking, and therefore, large pools of appropriate species are not immediately adjacent. The selectivity of warming-induced losses may lead to declines in functional and phylogenetic diversity as well as in species richness, especially in water-limited climates. Our current understanding of climate-caused diversity trends may be overly influenced by numerous studies coming from north-temperate alpine mountaintops, where conditions are unusually favourable for increases—possibly temporary—in local species richness.

Detecting extrapolation into novel conditions is a critical step in evaluating bioclimatic projections of how species and ecosystems will respond to climate change. However, biologically informed novelty detection methods remain elusive for many modeling algorithms. To assist with bioclimatic model design and evaluation, we present a first-approximation assessment of general novelty based on a simple and consistent characterization of climate. We build on the seminal global analysis of Williams et al. (2007 PNAS, 104, 5738) by assessing of end-of-21st-century novelty for North America at high spatial resolution and by refining their standardized Euclidean distance into an intuitive Mahalanobian metric called sigma dissimilarity. Like this previous study, we found extensive novelty in end-of-21st-century projections for the warm southern margin of the continent as well as the western Arctic. In addition, we detected localized novelty in lower topographic positions at all latitudes: By the end of the 21st century, novel climates are projected to emerge at low elevations in 80\% and 99\% of ecoregions in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios, respectively. Novel climates are limited to 7\% of the continent's area in RCP4.5, but are much more extensive in RCP8.5 (40\% of area). These three risk factors for novel climates – regional susceptibility, topographic position, and the magnitude of projected climate change – represent a priori evaluation criteria for the credibility of bioclimatic projections. Our findings indicate that novel climates can emerge in any landscape. Interpreting climatic novelty in the context of nonlinear biological responses to climate is an important challenge for future research.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models predict a wholesale redistribution of trees in the next century, yet migratory responses necessary to spatially track climates far exceed maximum post-glacial rates. The extent to which populations will adapt will depend upon phenotypic variation, strength of selection, fecundity, interspecific competition, and biotic interactions. Populations of temperate and boreal trees show moderate to strong clines in phenology and growth along temperature gradients, indicating substantial local adaptation. Traits involved in local adaptation appear to be the product of small effects of many genes, and the resulting genotypic redundancy combined with high fecundity may facilitate rapid local adaptation despite high gene flow. Gene flow with preadapted alleles from warmer climates may promote adaptation and migration at the leading edge, while populations at the rear will likely face extirpation. Widespread species with large populations and high fecundity are likely to persist and adapt, but will likely suffer adaptational lag for a few generations. As all tree species will be suffering lags, interspecific competition may weaken, facilitating persistence under suboptimal conditions. Species with small populations, fragmented ranges, low fecundity, or suffering declines due to introduced insects or diseases should be candidates for facilitated migration.},

	abstract = {Tree species are expected to track warming climate by shifting their ranges to higher latitudes or elevations, but current evidence of latitudinal range shifts for suites of species is largely indirect. In response to global warming, offspring of trees are predicted to have ranges extend beyond adults at leading edges and the opposite relationship at trailing edges. Large-scale forest inventory data provide an opportunity to compare present latitudes of seedlings and adult trees at their range limits. Using the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis data, we directly compared seedling and tree 5th and 95th percentile latitudes for 92 species in 30 longitudinal bands for 43 334 plots across the eastern United States. We further compared these latitudes with 20th century temperature and precipitation change and functional traits, including seed size and seed spread rate. Results suggest that 58.7\% of the tree species examined show the pattern expected for a population undergoing range contraction, rather than expansion, at both northern and southern boundaries. Fewer species show a pattern consistent with a northward shift (20.7\%) and fewer still with a southward shift (16.3\%). Only 4.3\% are consistent with expansion at both range limits. When compared with the 20th century climate changes that have occurred at the range boundaries themselves, there is no consistent evidence that population spread is greatest in areas where climate has changed most; nor are patterns related to seed size or dispersal characteristics. The fact that the majority of seedling extreme latitudes are less than those for adult trees may emphasize the lack of evidence for climate-mediated migration, and should increase concerns for the risks posed by climate change.},

However, long-term shifts in tree species ranges remain poorly documented. We test for shifts in the northern range limits of 16 temperate tree species in Quebec, Canada, using forest inventory data spanning three decades, 15° of longitude and 7° of latitude. Range shifts were correlated with climate warming and dispersal traits to understand potential mechanisms underlying changes. Shifts were calculated as the change in the 95th percentile of latitudinal occurrence between two inventory periods (1970-1978, 2000-2012) and for two life stages: saplings and adults. We also examined sapling and adult range offsets within each inventory, and changes in the offset through time. Tree species ranges shifted predominantly northward, although species responses varied. As expected shifts were greater for tree saplings, 0.34 km yr-1 , than for adults, 0.13 km yr-1 . Range limits were generally further north for adults compared to saplings, but the difference diminished through time, consistent with patterns observed for range shifts within each life stage. This suggests caution should be exercised when interpreting geographic range offsets between life stages as evidence of range shifts in the absence of temporal data. Species latitudinal velocities were on average {\textless}50\% of the velocity required to equal the spatial velocity of climate change and were mostly unrelated to dispersal traits. Finally, our results add to the body of evidence suggesting tree species are mostly limited in their capacity to track climate warming, supporting concerns that warming will negatively impact the functioning of forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of tree range dynamics has emerged as an important component of adaptive responses of forest management to global change scenarios such as extreme precipitation events and/or invasive species. Comparisons between the locations of adults versus seedlings of individual tree species using contemporary forest inventories is one tool widely used to assess the status of tree ranges in light of these changing conditions. With the consistent remeasurement of standard forest inventory plots across the entire eastern US occurring since the 2000s, the opportunity exists to evaluate the stability of tree ranges of focal species across a decade. Using said inventory, the northern range margins of tree distributions were examined by comparing differences (Holm-Sidak adjusted p-value = 0.2) in the 95th percentile locations of seedlings to adults (i.e., trees) by 0.5 degree longitudinal bands over nearly 10 years and by categories of canopy disturbance (i.e., canopy gap formation) for 20 study species. Our results suggest that range margins are stable for 85\% of study species at both time one and at remeasurement regardless of canopy disturbance. For the very few species that had a significant difference in seedlings and adults at their range margins, there was nearly a 0.4 degree difference in latitude with seedlings being farther south irrespective of disturbance. Our findings of tree range stability across forests of the eastern US indicate a general propensity towards range contraction, especially for study species forecasted to lose range and located on disturbed sites, which may present substantial hurdles for adaptive management strategies focused on maintaining and enhancing forest ecosystem resilience in the context of global change and associated rapid climate change.},

Based on 46 interviews with policy actors across Canada, our results suggest that the deployment of the first assisted migration policy in Canada successfully avoided the controversy surrounding the idea in the scientific community by changing the scientific discourse associated with best forest management practices.

While its risks and benefits have been debated, and suggestions for planning and management given, there is little consensus within the academic literature over whether to adopt it as a policy. We evaluated the main features of the assisted migration literature including the study methods, taxonomic groups, geographic regions and disciplines involved. We further assessed the debate about the use of assisted migration, the main barriers to consensus, and the range of recommendations put forth in the literature for policy, planning or implementation. Commentaries and secondary literature reviews were as prevalent as first-hand scientific research and attention focussed on a global rather than regional level. There was little evidence of knowledge transfer outside of the natural sciences, despite the obvious policy relevance. Scholarly debate on this topic has intensified during the last 3years. We present a conceptual framework for evaluating arguments in the debate, distinguishing among the direct risks and benefits to species, ecosystems and society on the one hand, and other arguments regarding scientific justification, evidence-base and feasibility on the other. We also identify recommendations with potential to advance the debate, including careful evaluation of risks, benefits and trade-offs, involvement of relevant stakeholders and consideration of the complementarity among assisted migration and less risk-tolerant strategies. We conclude, however, that none of these will solve the fundamental, often values-based, challenges in the debate.

These pressures, collectively, demand land managers to reassess current and potential forest management practices. We discuss three considerations, functional restoration, assisted migration, and bioengineering, which are currently being debated in the literature and have the potential to be applied independently or concurrently across a variety of scales. The emphasis of functional restoration is to reestablish or maintain functions provided by the forest ecosystem, such as water quality, wildlife habitat, or carbon sequestration. Maintaining function may call upon actions such as assisted migration—moving tree populations within a species current range to aid adaptation to climate change or moving a species far outside its current range to avoid extinction—and we attempt to synthesize an array of assisted migration terminology. In addition, maintenance of species and the functions they provide may also require new technologies, such as genetic engineering, which, compared with traditional approaches to breeding for pest resistance, may be accomplished more rapidly to meet and overcome the challenges of invasive insect and disease pests. As managers develop holistic adaptive strategies to current and future anthropogenic stresses, functional restoration, assisted migration, and bioengineering, either separately or in combinations, deserve consideration, but must be addressed within the context of the restoration goal.},

These range from actions designed to increase the resistance of current composition and structure to negative impacts to those designed to transition forests to substantially different characteristics. A component of many adaptation approaches will likely include assisted migration of future climate-adapted tree species or genotypes. While forest-assisted migration (FAM) has been discussed conceptually and examined experimentally for almost a decade, operationalizing FAM (i.e., routine use in forest conservation and management projects) lags behind the acceptance of the need for climate adaptation. As the vulnerability of forest ecosystems in climate change increases, FAM may need to become an integral management tool to reduce long-term risks to ecosystem function, despite real and perceived barriers for its implementation. Here we discuss the concept of operational-scale FAM and why it remains a controversial, not yet widely adopted component of climate adaptation. We present three case studies of operational-scale FAM to illustrate how the practice can be approached pragmatically within an adaptation framework despite the barriers to acceptance. Finally, we discuss a path toward advancing the wide use of operational-scale FAM.},

	abstract = {Forest managers are considering assisted migration as a strategy to develop climate-resilient forests. Assisted migration (AM) is the translocation of species or genotypes from their current ranges to areas predicted to have a supportive future climate. Although correlations of species ranges with climate are traditionally used to explore AM potential, successful AM strategies will have to consider many other variables. In this article, we review recent research that informs the complexity of AM decisions. Local microenvironment, herbivory, and intraspecific interactions frequently outweigh climate in determining species establishment and survival. Species adopt several strategies to cope with drought, heat, and cold, but translocated genetic material can display cryptic maladaptation when challenged by extreme, out-of-range weather events. Phenology, photoperiod, and climate are related in complex, often provenance-specific ways. We discuss the implications of our findings for forestry AM and make recommendations for incorporating these insights into future research and AM practice.},

	abstract = {Considerable uncertainties remain about magnitude and character, if not general direction of anthropogenic climate change. Global mean temperature could increase by 1.5–4.5°C or more over historic levels, and extreme weather events—drought, storms, and flooding—are likely to increase greatly in frequency. Although ecologists and foresters agree that the practice of forestry will be transformed under climate change, these uncertainties compound the challenge of achieving sustainable, adaptive forest management. In this aritcle, we (i) present a multidisciplinary synthesis of current knowledge of responses of temperate and boreal tree species and forest communities to climate change, and (ii) outline silvicultural strategies for adapting temperate and boreal forests to confront climate change. Our knowledge synthesis proceeds through critical appraisals of efforts to model future tree distributions and responses to climate change, and reviews physiological, phenological, acclimation, and epigenetic responses to climate. As is the case of climate change itself, there are numerous uncertainties about tree species and provenance responses to climate change. For example, acclimation of respiration and epigenetic conditioning of seed embryos has the potential to buffer species against limited warming. Provenances within species also display idiosyncratic responses to altered climates, implying that soemm varieties will be more resilient or resistant to climate change than others. Genetically determined limits to climatic tolerance, and the limits of tree community resistance and resilience (speed of recovery from disturbance) in the face of climate-related disturbances are largely unknown. These unknowns require managers to adopt a portfolio of silvicultural strategies, which may range from minor modifications of current practices to design of novel multi-species stands that may have no historical analogue. Forest managers must be prepared to respond nimbly as they develop, incorporate new insights about climate change and species responses to warming into their practices. Marshalling all strategies and sources of knowledge should enable forest managers to mount (at least) a partially successful response to the challenges of climate change.},

	abstract = {Global climate models are constantly being upgraded, but it is often not clear what these changes have on climate change impact projections. We used difference maps to directly compare downscaled projections of temperature and precipitation across North America for two versions (or generations) of three different Atmospheric-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCM)s. We found that AOGCM versions differed in their projections for the end of the current century by up to 4 °C for annual mean temperature and 60\% for annual precipitation. To place these changes in an ecological context, we reanalyzed our work on shifts in tree climate envelopes (CEs) using the newer-generation AOGCM projections. Based on the updated AOGCMs, by the 2071–2100 period, tree CEs shifted up to 2.4 degrees further north or 2.6 degrees further south (depending on the AOGCM) and were about 10\% larger in size. Despite considerable differences between versions of a given AOGCM, projections made by the newer version of each AOGCM were in general agreement, suggesting convergence across the three models studied here. Assessing the AOGCM outputs in this way provides insight into the magnitude and importance of change associated with AOGCM upgrades as they continue to evolve through time.},

This carbon sink seems to be in decline, however, as a result of factors such as deforestation and climate change1–3. Here we investigate Amazonia’s carbon budget and the main drivers responsible for its change into a carbon source. We performed 590 aircraft vertical profiling measurements of lower-tropospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide at four sites in Amazonia from 2010 to 20184. We find that total carbon emissions are greater in eastern Amazonia than in the western part, mostly as a result of spatial differences in carbon-monoxide-derived fire emissions. Southeastern Amazonia, in particular, acts as a net carbon source (total carbon flux minus fire emissions) to the atmosphere. Over the past 40 years, eastern Amazonia has been subjected to more deforestation, warming and moisture stress than the western part, especially during the dry season, with the southeast experiencing the strongest trends5–9. We explore the effect of climate change and deforestation trends on carbon emissions at our study sites, and find that the intensification of the dry season and an increase in deforestation seem to promote ecosystem stress, increase in fire occurrence, and higher carbon emissions in the eastern Amazon. This is in line with recent studies that indicate an increase in tree mortality and a reduction in photosynthesis as a result of climatic changes across Amazonia1,10.},

Quantifying forest vulnerability to disturbances and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, observational evidence is largely missing at regional to continental scales. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of European forests to fires, windthrows and insect outbreaks during the period 1979–2018 by integrating machine learning with disturbance data and satellite products. We show that about 33.4 billion tonnes of forest biomass could be seriously affected by these disturbances, with higher relative losses when exposed to windthrows (40\%) and fires (34\%) compared to insect outbreaks (26\%). The spatial pattern in vulnerability is strongly controlled by the interplay between forest characteristics and background climate. Hotspot regions for vulnerability are located at the borders of the climate envelope, in both southern and northern Europe. There is a clear trend in overall forest vulnerability that is driven by a warming-induced reduction in plant defence mechanisms to insect outbreaks, especially at high latitudes.},

This is reflected in unexpected disturbance events, as well as new and increasing socio-economic demands, all of which are affecting the resilience of forest ecosystems worldwide and the provision of important ecosystem services. This Anthropocene era is forcing us to reconsider past and current forest management and silvicultural practices, and search for new ones that are more flexible and better at dealing with the increasing uncertainty brought about by these accelerating and cumulative global changes. Here, we briefly review the focus and limitations of past and current forest management and silvicultural practices mainly as developed in Europe and North America. We then discuss some recent promising concepts, such as managing forests as complex adaptive systems, and approaches based on resilience, functional diversity, assisted migration and multi-species plantations, to propose a novel approach to integrate the functionality of species-traits into a functional complex network approach as a flexible and multi-scale way to manage forests for the Anthropocene. This approach takes into consideration the high level of uncertainty associated with future environmental and societal changes. It relies on the quantification and dynamic monitoring of functional diversity and complex network indices to manage forests as a functional complex network. Using this novel approach, the most efficient forest management and silvicultural practices can be determined, as well as where, at what scale, and at what intensity landscape-scale resistance, resilience and adaptive capacity of forests to global changes can be improved.},

Furthermore, we propose five concrete steps to foster the adoption of diverse planted forests: (1) improve awareness of benefits and practical options of diverse planted forests among land-owners, managers, and investors; (2) incentivize tree species diversity in public funding of afforestation and programs to diversify current maladapted planted forests of low diversity; (3) develop new wood-based products that can be derived from many different tree species not yet in use; (4) invest in research to assess landscape benefits of diverse planted forests for functional connectivity and resilience to global-change threats; and (5) improve the evidence base on diverse planted forests, in particular in currently under-represented regions, where new options could be tested.},

	abstract = {Land use policies have turned southern China into one of the most intensively managed forest regions in the world, with actions maximizing forest cover on soils with marginal agricultural potential while concurrently increasing livelihoods and mitigating climate change. Based on satellite observations, here we show that diverse land use changes in southern China have increased standing aboveground carbon stocks by 0.11 ± 0.05 Pg C y−1 during 2002–2017. Most of this regional carbon sink was contributed by newly established forests (32\%), while forests already existing contributed 24\%. Forest growth in harvested forest areas contributed 16\% and non-forest areas contributed 28\% to the carbon sink, while timber harvest was tripled. Soil moisture declined significantly in 8\% of the area. We demonstrate that land management in southern China has been removing an amount of carbon equivalent to 33\% of regional fossil CO2 emissions during the last 6 years, but forest growth saturation, land competition for food production and soil-water depletion challenge the longevity of this carbon sink service.},

Forest floor samples were collected 2.5 years after harvest from clearcuts, strip-cut corridors in a partial cut, green tree retention patches in a partial cut, and uncut control sites. Partial cuts showed intermediate decreases in annual litter input and NH4-N between uncut and clear-cut sites of both the deciduous and conifer stands, as did microbial biomass, PO4-P, mesofauna abundance (total, Acari, and Collembola), and fine root biomass in the conifer stands. In the deciduous stands, microbial biomass and fine root biomass in partial- and clear-cut treatments were not significantly different, but were significantly reduced compared with the uncut controls. Mesofauna abundance was reduced in the corridors of the partial-cut treatment compared with partial-cut patch, clear-cut, and uncut treatments. In both deciduous and conifer stands, NO3-N was elevated in the partial-cut corridors and clearcuts compared with partial-cut patch and uncut treatments. Findings from this study show that negative impact to forest floor properties associated with clear-cut harvesting may be reduced in partial-cut harvesting systems.},

	abstract = {Clear-cutting is a controversial practice that is widely applied in forests managed for wood production in many parts of the world. This paper aims to provide an objective synthesis of the ecological effects of clear-cutting as a basis for more informed discussion of its merits and disadvantages. A definition of clear-cutting is put forward, and its place in modern productive forestry is described. Effects on microclimate, water, soil, nutrient cycling, and the diversity and composition of plant and animal species are reviewed. The effects of clear-cutting vary considerably depending on site conditions (such as climate, geology, and topography) and on the structure and composition of the forest, the extent and distribution of harvesting, the method used to extract the logs, and the length of time before the forest is removed again. However, it is evident that many of the ecological impacts commonly ascribed to clear-cutting, in fact, result from other stages of the wood-production process, such as the quality and intensity of roading, site preparation practices (such as mechanical disturbance or slash burning), and the intensity of control of noncrop vegetation. Situations where clear-cutting is inappropriate are described. It is argued that in the right situations, with appropriate safeguards, it is an environmentally sound practice that offers many advantages in terms of the production of wood fibre.Key words: clear-cutting, environmental impacts, microclimate, hydrology, soil, forest production, nutrient cycling, wildlife.},

	abstract = {A secondary succession sequence of 14 northern hardwoods stands was sampled for forest floor organic matter and nutrient content. During the first 15 yr following clear cutting, the forest floor decreased by 30.7 Mg/ha, a decline of over 50\%. The decrease in the forest floor and slash (logging residue) may be greater than the increase in the living biomass. During the next 50 yr the forest floor increased by 28.0 Mg/ha and by year 64 was within 5\% of an asymptote of 56.0 Mg/ha. Nutrients were analyzed in 6 of the 14 stands. Magnesium, potassium, and nitrogen concentrations showed no successional pattern. However, calcium concentrations were significantly higher in the stands in which forest floor mass was low. The initial decrease in forest floor mass is attributed to lower leaf and wood litter fall and to more rapid decay resulting from higher temperature, moisture content, and nutrient levels and to early successional litter being more easily decomposed. The recovery of the forest floor is explained primarily as resulting from the rapid increase in the quantity and diameter of wood litter fall. JABOWA, the northern hardwood forest growth simulator, predicts a maximum rate of increase in woody litter by years 10-20 with a leveling off by years 30-50. An apparent asynchrony in function of the forest floor and slash as nutrient sources may be important to the recovery process. During the first 15 yr the forest floor is a major source of nutrients, releasing a net amount of approximately 800 kg/ha of nitrogen. During this period nitrogen immobilization in the decay of slash may account for as much as one-half of the nitrogen released from the forest floor. After year 15 the forest floor is no longer a source but a sink for nutrients as nutrients and organic matter accumulate. By year 15 the slash probably shifts in function from a sink to a source, providing nitrogen for the continuing rapid nitrogen accumulation in vegetation beyond year 15.},

However, none has experimentally compared clearcutting with multiple alternative timber-harvest methods. Using a randomized, replicated design, we compared the short-term effects ( 1–4 years after harvest ) of clearcutting to effects of leavetree, group selection, and two shelterwood cuts on terrestrial salamanders in the southern Appalachian Mountains of Virginia and West Virginia ( U.S.A. ). Treatment plots were 2 ha each. We also compared salamander age class ( percent juvenile ), fecundity ( percentage of females carrying eggs and average number of eggs per gravid female ), size of gravid females, and species composition and diversity between treatments with canopy removal ( cut ) and those without canopy removal ( uncut ). All treatments with canopy removal had significantly fewer salamanders than the control treatment, but salamander abundances on alternative treatments with canopy removal did not differ significantly from salamander abundances on the clearcuts. There were no significant differences between cut and uncut treatments in the proportion of females that were gravid or in the average number of eggs in gravid females; however, gravid Plethodon cinereus females weighed more on the cut treatments and gravid Desmognathus ochrophaeus females weighed more on uncut treatments. There were no significant differences between cut and uncut treatments in the proportion of the sample that was juvenile, except in the largest species tested, P. glutinosus, which had a significantly higher proportion of juveniles in the uncut treatments. We conclude that initial declines in terrestrial plethodontid abundance caused by timber harvesting may be minimized across the landscape by concentrating high-intensity timber harvesting ( clearcutting ) in small areas ( a few hectares in size ).},

We used pitfall traps to sample 4 previously harvested 45-60-year-old forested areas and 4 adjacent areas clearcut 2-5 years previously. In a separate experiment, we conducted surveys before and after thinning on 4 control and 4 treatment sites. Western red-backed salamanders (Plethodon vehiculum), ensatinas (Ensatina eschscholtzii), northwestern salamanders (Ambystoma gracile), rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa), and Dunn's salamanders (Plethodon dunni) were captured in both forested and clearcut areas. Columbia torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton kezeri) and Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) were captured only in forested areas. Capture rates of red-backed salamanders were greater in forested than clearcut areas in fall 1994 and 1995). The size-class distribution of red-backed salamanders was skewed toward the smaller size classes in clearcut areas in fall 1994 but not fall 1995. Ensatina showed no difference in capture rate or size-class distribution between forested and clearcut areas in fall 1994, but showed a reduced rate of capture in clearcut areas relative to forested areas in fall 1995. Gravid females were present in both clearcut and forested areas for western red-backed salamanders and ensatinas. Although species presence was unaffected by thinning, western red-backed salamander capture rates on treatment sites were reduced after thinning. Population responses of salamander species to forest management are variable, with some species declining in abundance after clearcutting and thinning.},

However, the reaction of soil fauna to forest harvesting differed significantly among the taxonomic groups, with negative, neutral, and positive effects observed. We found that the negative effect of forest harvesting on soil fauna increased with decreasing body size. In addition, the type of forest and harvesting practice played important roles in driving the responses of soil biota to forest harvesting. The abundance of Nematoda, Oribatida, and Enchytraeidae recovered to control values occurring approximately 10 years after harvesting. Despite the limitations of the dataset, the results obtained from our meta-analysis expand our understanding of the reaction of soil fauna to forest harvesting.},

We evaluated the most common timber production systems worldwide in terms of their impact on local species richness by conducting a categorical meta-analysis. We reviewed 287 published studies containing 1008 comparisons of species richness in managed and unmanaged forests and derived management, taxon and continent specific effect sizes. We show that in terms of local species richness loss, forest management types can be ranked, from best to worse, as follows: selection and retention systems, reduced impact logging, conventional selective logging, clear-cutting, agroforestry, timber plantations, fuelwood plantations. Next, we calculated the economic profitability in terms of the net present value of timber harvesting from 10 hypothetical wood-producing Forest Management Units (FMU) from around the globe. The ranking of management types is altered when the species loss per unit profit generated from the FMU is considered. This is due to differences in yield, timber species prices, rotation cycle length and production costs. We thus conclude that it would be erroneous to dismiss or prioritize timber production regimes, based solely on their ranking of alpha diversity impacts.},

Changes in forest structure, composition, and dynamics inevitably lead to changes in the biodiversity of forest-dwelling species. However, the possible biodiversity gains and losses due to forest management (i.e. anthropogenic pressures related to direct forest resource use) have never been assessed at a pan-European scale. We used meta-analysis to review 49 published papers containing 120 individual comparisons of species richness between unmanaged and managed forests throughout Europe. We explored the response of different taxonomic groups and the variability of their response with respect to time since abandonment and intensity of forest management. Species richness was slightly higher in unmanaged than in managed forests. Species dependent on forest cover continuity, deadwood, and large trees (bryophytes, lichens, fungi, saproxylic beetles) and carabids were negatively affected by forest management. In contrast, vascular plant species were favored. The response for birds was heterogeneous and probably depended more on factors such as landscape patterns. The global difference in species richness between unmanaged and managed forests increased with time since abandonment and indicated a gradual recovery of biodiversity. Clear-cut forests with tree species composition change had the strongest effect on species richness, but the effects of different types of management on taxa could not be assessed in a robust way because of low numbers of replications in the management-intensity classes. Our results show that some taxa are more affected by forestry than others, but there is a need for research into poorly studied species groups in Europe and in particular locations. Our meta-analysis supports the need for a coordinated European research network to study and monitor the biodiversity of different taxa in managed and unmanaged forests.},

If residual forest aggregates are to serve as temporary refugia for species sensitive to disturbance or environmental stress, microclimatic conditions must be sufficiently buffered to allow for their persistence. In 1-ha aggregates at three experimental sites in western Washington, we quantified spatial gradients in microclimate (light, air and soil temperature, and soil moisture), effects of aspect on these gradients, and how microclimate compared to conditions in adjacent harvest areas and larger tracts of undisturbed forest (controls). Light availability and temperature were greatest at the edge, but declined sharply inside the aggregate, with most change occurring within 20m of the edge. Beyond this distance, light generally declined to levels observed in the controls. Soil temperatures exhibited greater spatial variation and stabilized further from the edge (10–30m), but air temperatures were generally higher than those in controls. Soil moisture exhibited no spatial trends and was comparable among aggregates, harvest areas, and controls. Aspect exerted strong effects on light and temperature, particularly within 15m of the edge, as did forest structure. Where tree density was low, microclimatic gradients were less steep and aspect-related differences were small. Comparisons with previous studies of ground vegetation indicate that microclimatic effects were consistent, in part, with declines among some groups of vascular and non-vascular plants; however, these declines were restricted to edge environments (5–10m) and were unaffected by aspect. Our results suggest that 1-ha aggregates are sufficiently large to contain areas with light, temperature, and soil moisture that are comparable to those in undisturbed forest and suitable, in the short-term, for persistence of forest-dependent species.},

(1) Fragmentation of forests and the size of a fragment appear not to be crucial for the survival of the majority of forest carabids, as they tend to be distributed over various successional stages, but species requiring old-growth habitats suffer. (2) For carabids there appear to be no or very few edge specialist species, and forest-open land edges appear to be effective barriers for species associated with forest or open habitat. However, generalist species easily cross the edge, and edges of forest fragments may be invaded by species from the surrounding open habitat. (3) Habitat change following clear-cutting dramatically changes the composition of carabid assemblages: species restricted to mature forests disappear and open-habitat species invade, while habitat generalists survive at least in the short term. Carabid diversity can probably best be maintained if forest management mimics natural processes, maintains natural structures and includes the natural composition of vegetation and other structural elements (such as dead wood) within the stands, provided that these forest features can be maintained and recreated through forest management practices. At a larger scale, the whole spectrum of forest types and ages (especially old-growth forests), and different successional processes (especially fire) should be maintained. These require the development and use of innovative logging methods, and the planning, implementation, and assessment of landscape-scale ecological management strategies.},

	abstract = {Staphylinid beetle assemblages from coniferous foothills forest in west-central Alberta, Canada were studied via pitfall trapping to examine the effects of stand age and possible edge effects. Sites included a chronosequence of stands from 1 to 27 years post-harvest, and four types of mature forest that had not been disturbed by fire for at least 80 years. In all, 19 sites were sampled between 1989 and 1991. A total of 98 species were identified, nine of which are reported for the first time in Alberta. Staphylinids were more abundant in mature forest stands but assemblages were more diverse in regenerating stands. Thirty-four rove beetle species showed significant indicator value for particular stands or groups of stands, including mature forest, young forest, and open ground specialists. After harvesting, the catch rate of many forest species decreased dramatically, and open ground species were more commonly collected. Populations of some forest species remained active on logged sites for one or 2 years before disappearing. As stands regenerated, they were colonized by species characteristic of young stands, but true forest species were found only in older unharvested stands. The beetle assemblages from regenerating stands became more similar to those from mature stands as they aged, but still differed considerably from them 27 years after harvesting. Transects across forest-clearcut edges revealed a significant beetle response to habitat edges. Staphylinids assemblages were compared to the ground beetle (Carabidae) assemblage sampled via the same pitfall trapping regime. Mature forest specialists are threatened by fragmentation and loss of habitat. In order to conserve these beetle assemblages, forest managers should retain adequate patches of older successional stages on working landscapes.},

	abstract = {Over 80\% of amphibian species that are declining are forest dependent. Forestry practices are a major cause of forest alterations globally, and it is well documented that clearcutting can contribute to amphibian declines. However, there might be adverse effects of forestry practices other than clearcutting. For example, planting overstory trees in rows (plantations) can change groundcover microhabitats and soil moisture levels, but the effects of this common practice on amphibian populations are not well studied. We compared the impacts of common intensive pine plantation operations to naturally regenerated pine forests on the desiccation, movement rates, behavior, and survival of {\textgreater}900 juvenile southern toads (Anaxyrus terrestris). Pine plantations had significantly more accumulation of conifer needles and less exposed soil, herbaceous groundcover, broadleaf litter, and soil moisture than natural pine forests despite the greater canopy cover at plantations. Litter cover explained 85\% of groundcover microhabitat variance among forest types and predicted minimum soil moisture levels. When toads were held in small outdoor enclosures that constrained microhabitat selection, 24-h desiccation rates and 72-h mortality were significantly greater in pine plantation than in naturally regenerated pine forest because of lower soil moisture, especially during low rainfall periods. In large outdoor pens where juvenile amphibians could select microhabitats, movement was strongly directed down slope and increased with precipitation. However, initial speeds were positively associated with pine density, likely because toads were trying to evacuate from the drier high-pine-density areas. High-intensity silviculture practices that eliminate herbaceous or vegetative groundcover, such as roller chopping and scalping, increase amphibian desiccation because planted conifers dry the upper soil layer. Our study highlights the importance of prioritizing lower intensity silviculture practices or lower pine densities to retain groundcover microhabitat that serves as amphibian refugia from dry conditions that are predicted to increase in frequency with climate change.},

We then review indicator potentials of arthropod groups to explore the ecological consequences of forest management practices. Different arthropod groups respond differently to forest management. Ants, carabid beetles, and spiders often respond to local-scale, disturbance-induced vegetation development caused by thinning and can be used to infer the ecological suitability of forest management treatments. Dung beetles and moths respond to habitat alterations caused by forest fragmentation and can indicate the suitability of landscape-level forest management techniques. Butterflies and cerambycid beetles respond highly positively to the presence of herbaceous plants and understory trees and can be used to infer the integrity of thinning treatments in forest management. Syrphid flies, which are strong flyers associated with vegetation complexity, can be used as bioindicators of landscape-level forest management practices. Monitoring regulatory service providers may also help when designing forest management practices. We propose using arthropod bioindicator groups to effectively design and assess ecologically sustainable management plans for both natural and plantation forests.},

	abstract = {The high functional and unmatched biological diversity represented by arthropods demand that these organisms be considered as ecological indicators of sustainable forest management. Successful use of arthropods in this capacity will require a systematic and rigorous process, including selection of potential indicators, definition of relationships between indicators and disturbance variables, optimization of the useful range of the indicator and application of the indicator(s) in monitoring. In Canada, the single greatest impediment to the use of arthropods as ecological indicators is the importance of accurate species-level identification and the difficulty achieving it. Consequently, most work has focused on a few relatively well-known groups (e.g., epigaeic carabid and staphylinid beetles and spiders, saproxylic beetles, butterflies and larger night flying moths).Many recent studies have provided baseline data about the range of natural variation and have begun to quantify arthropod responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the context of preplanned experiments or through various retrospective approaches. Carabid beetles are the best-studied group and sufficient sets of data now exist to permit a meta-analysis of the robustness of carabids as indicators across multiple spatial scales and in terms of how well they represent broader ecological responses to disturbances. There is good potential to incorporate arthropod indicators into monitoring programs in Canada, but it is necessary to first complete a scientifically credible selection process for specific ecological indicators. Future research should focus on completing the process for taxa under current study as this develops the best presently understood opportunities for using arthropod indicators in assessing various aspects of environmental change. Researchers should also consider other means of monitoring arthropod biodiversity by the use of surrogate ecological parameters such as ecological land classification and habitat classification systems.

Here we show that a recent mass extinction associated with pathogen outbreaks is tied to global warming. Seventeen years ago, in the mountains of Costa Rica, the Monteverde harlequin frog (Atelopus sp.) vanished along with the golden toad (Bufo periglenes). An estimated 67\% of the 110 or so species of Atelopus, which are endemic to the American tropics, have met the same fate, and a pathogenic chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) is implicated. Analysing the timing of losses in relation to changes in sea surface and air temperatures, we conclude with ‘very high confidence’ ({\textgreater} 99\%, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) that large-scale warming is a key factor in the disappearances. We propose that temperatures at many highland localities are shifting towards the growth optimum of Batrachochytrium, thus encouraging outbreaks. With climate change promoting infectious disease and eroding biodiversity, the urgency of reducing greenhouse-gas concentrations is now undeniable.},

	abstract = {Successful multi-use planning for forested landscapes requires an understanding of timber management effects on wildlife species. Lungless, woodland salamanders depend on forested habitats and are sensitive to changes in temperature and moisture associated with many forestry practices. Additionally, woodland salamanders are territorial and have relatively low vagility, making it unlikely that they can successfully migrate to more favorable habitat when the surrounding forest is harvested. Therefore, we examined the abundance of the Western Slimy Salamander, Plethodon albagula, in an experimentally manipulated forest in central Missouri. We used artificial cover object searches to compare salamander abundance in three replicate treatments that were clear-cut then burned to reduce maple regeneration, clear-cut and not burned, partially harvested, and un-manipulated control forest. We captured a total of 300 Western Slimy Salamanders between April 2007 and September 2011. We found significantly fewer salamanders in the burn and clear-cut treatments compared with the partial and control treatments. We also found a lower proportion of juveniles and had fewer recaptures in the burn and clear-cut than in the partial and control treatments. Consistent with other studies of woodland salamanders, our results suggest that for at least the first 7years post-harvest, clear-cutting is detrimental to woodland salamander populations. This initial reduction in abundance combined with the further reduced proportion of juveniles may have longer lasting effects even as the forest regenerates. Finally, it appears that timber harvest resulting in limited canopy thinning may be compatible with maintaining populations of Western Slimy Salamanders in Missouri.},

Increasing natural-caused fires throughout western United States national forests could place people, property, and infrastructure at risk in the future. We used the fine K nearest neighbor (KNN) method coupled with the downscaled Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) climate dataset to estimate changes in the rate of natural-caused fires in western United States national forests. We projected changes in the rate of minor and major forest fires from historical (1986-2015) to future (2070-2099) conditions to characterize fire-prone national forests under a range of climate change scenarios. The results indicate that climate change can add to the occurrence of forest fires in western United States national forests, particularly in Rocky Mountain, Pacific Southwest, and Southwestern United States Forest Service regions. Although summer months are projected to have the highest rate of natural-caused forest fire activity in the future, the rate of natural-caused forest fires is likely to increase from August to December in the future compared to the historical conditions. Improved understanding of altered forest fire regimes can help forest managers to better understand the potential effects of climate change on future fire activity and implement actions to attenuate possible negative consequences.},

	abstract = {Nearly 4 \% of the world’s forests are plantations, established to provide a variety of ecosystem services, principally timber and other wood products. In addition to such services, plantation forests provide direct and indirect benefits to biodiversity via the provision of forest habitat for a wide range of species, and by reducing negative impacts on natural forests by offsetting the need to extract resources. There is compelling evidence that climate change is directly affecting biodiversity in forests throughout the world. These impacts occur as a result of changes in temperature, rainfall, storm frequency and magnitude, fire frequency, and the frequency and magnitude of pest and disease outbreaks. However, in plantation forests it is not only the direct effects of climate change that will impact on biodiversity. Climate change will have strong indirect effects on biodiversity in plantation forests via changes in forest management actions that have been proposed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the productive capacity of plantations. These include changes in species selection (including use of species mixtures), rotation length, thinning, pruning, extraction of bioenergy feedstocks, and large scale climate change driven afforestation, reforestation, and, potentially deforestation. By bringing together the potential direct and indirect impacts of climate change we conclude that in the short to medium term changes in plantation management designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change could have a significantly greater impact on biodiversity in such plantation forests than the direct effects of climate change. Although this hypothesis remains to be formally tested, forest managers worldwide are already considering new approaches to plantation forestry in an effort to create forests that are more resilient to the effects of changing climatic conditions. Such change presents significant risks to existing biodiversity values in plantation forests, however it also provides new opportunities to improve biodiversity values within existing and new plantation forests. We conclude by suggesting future options, such as functional zoning and species mixtures applied at either the stand level or as fine-scale mosaics of single-species stands as options to improve biodiversity whilst increasing resilience to climate change.},

	abstract = {A number of previous modeling studies have assessed the implications of projected CO2-induced climate change for future terrestrial ecosystems. However, although current understanding of possible long-term response of vegetation to elevated CO2 and CO2-induced climate change in some geographical areas (e.g., the high-latitude regions) has been strengthened by dint of accumulating evidence from these past studies, it is still weak in others. This study examines the responses of global potential natural vegetation distribution, net primary production (NPP), and fire emissions to future changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Land Model's dynamic global vegetation model. The model is run to vegetative equilibrium (i.e., with respect to leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation coverage) driven with preindustrial climate and future climate near 2100, respectively, simulated by eight general circulation models (GCMs). The simulated potential vegetation under the preindustrial control mean climate (CO2 concentration held at 275 ppm) is compared with that under the SRESA1B 2100 mean climate (CO2 concentration stabilizes at 720 ppm beyond 2100). Simulated vegetation response ranges from mild changes of the fractional coverage of different plant functional types to the rather dramatic changes of dominant plant functional types. Although such response differs significantly across different GCM climate projections, a quite consistent spatial pattern emerges, characterized by a considerable poleward spread or shift of temperate and boreal forests in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, and a substantial degradation of vegetation type in the tropics (e.g., increase of drought deciduous trees coverage at the expense of evergreen trees) especially in portions of West and southern Africa and South America. Despite the widespread degradation of vegetation type in the tropics, NPP, and growing season LAI are predicted to increase under most GCM scenarios over most of the globe. Carbon fluxes to the atmosphere due to fire generally increase too across the globe. Such responses of NPP and fire occurrence result from the synergistic effects of CO2 concentration changes, climate changes, and vegetation changes. In the HadCM-driven simulation, however, extreme responses are shown in some regions: Deciduous forest is replaced by grasses in large areas in the middle latitudes, and substantial areas in northern South America and southern Africa predominantly covered by evergreen forest are replaced with grasses while NPP and fire emissions reduce drastically (by more than 100\%). A future paper will examine how the biosphere response documented here influences the impact of climate change on surface hydrological conditions.},

	abstract = {Despite the numerous studies which have been conducted during the past decade on species ranges and their relationship to the environment, our understanding of how environmental conditions shape species distribution is still far from complete. Yet, some process-based species distribution models have been able to simulate plants and insects distribution at a global scale. These models strongly rely on the completion of the annual cycle of the species and therefore on their accomplished phenology. In particular, they have shown that the northern limit of species' ranges appears to be caused mainly by the inability to undergo full fruit maturation, while the southern limit appears to be caused by the inability to flower or unfold leaves owing to a lack of chilling temperatures that are necessary to break bud dormancy. I discuss here why phenology is a key adaptive trait in shaping species distribution using mostly examples from plant species, which have been the most documented. After discussing how phenology is involved in fitness and why it is an adaptive trait susceptible to evolve quickly in changing climate conditions, I describe how phenology is related to fitness in species distribution process-based models and discuss the fate of species under climate change scenarios using model projections and experimental or field studies from the literature.},

	abstract = {New analyses are presented addressing the global impacts of recent climate change on phenology of plant and animal species. A meta-analysis spanning 203 species was conducted on published datasets from the northern hemisphere. Phenological response was examined with respect to two factors: distribution of species across latitudes and taxonomic affiliation or functional grouping of target species. Amphibians had a significantly stronger shift toward earlier breeding than all other taxonomic/functional groups, advancing more than twice as fast as trees, birds and butterflies. In turn, butterfly emergence or migratory arrival showed three times stronger advancement than the first flowering of herbs, perhaps portending increasing asynchrony in insect–plant interactions. Response was significantly stronger at higher latitudes where warming has been stronger, but latitude explained {\textless} 4\% of the variation. Despite expectation, latitude was not yet an important predictor of climate change impacts on phenology. The only two previously published estimates of the magnitude of global response are quite different: 2.3 and 5.1daysdecade−1 advancement. The scientific community has assumed this difference to be real and has attempted to explain it in terms of biologically relevant phenomena: specifically, differences in distribution of data across latitudes, taxa or time periods. Here, these and other possibilities are explored. All analyses indicate that the difference in estimated response is primarily due to differences between the studies in criteria for incorporating data. It is a clear and automatic consequence of the exclusion by one study of data on ‘stable’ (nonresponsive) species. Once this is accounted for, the two studies support each other, generating similar conclusions despite analyzing substantially nonoverlapping datasets. Analyses here on a new expanded dataset estimate an overall spring advancement across the northern hemisphere of 2.8daysdecade−1. This is the first quantitative analysis showing that data-sampling methodologies significantly impact global (synthetic) estimates of magnitude of global warming response.},

	abstract = {Recent climatic trends and climate model projections indicate that climate change will modify rangeland ecosystem functions and the services and livelihoods that they provision. Recent history has demonstrated that climatic variability has a strong influence on both ecological and social components of rangeland systems and that these systems possess substantial capacity to adapt to climatic variability. Specific objectives of this synthesis are to: 1) evaluate options to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and future climate change; 2) survey actions that individuals, enterprises, and social organizations can use to adapt to climate change; and 3) assess options for system transformation when adaptation is no longer sufficient to contend with climate change. Mitigation for carbon sequestration does not appear economically viable, given the small and highly variable carbon dioxide fluxes of rangeland ecosystems and the high transaction costs that would be incurred. In contrast, adaptation strategies are numerous and provide a means to manage risks associated with climate change. Adaptation strategies are diverse, including altered risk perception by individuals, greater flexibility of production enterprises, and modifications to social organizations that emphasize climatic variability, rather than consistency. Many adaptations represent “no regrets” actions because their implementation can be justified without emphasis on pending climate change. Adaptations specific to livestock production systems can include flexible herd management, alternative livestock breeds or species, innovative pest management, modified enterprise structures, and geographic relocation. Social-ecological systems in which adaptation is insufficient to counter the adverse consequences of climate change might undergo transformative change to produce alternative ecosystem services, production enterprises, and livelihoods. The rangeland profession is in a pivotal position to provide leadership on this global challenge because it represents the intersection of management and scientific knowledge, includes diverse stakeholders who derive their livelihoods from rangelands, and interacts with organizations responsible for rangeland stewardship.},

Partial harvest methods have been used extensively in temperate broadleaf and mixedwood ecosystems to promote regeneration on poorly stocked sites and to maintain forest composition and productivity. However, their effectiveness in promoting conifer establishment has yet to be demonstrated in unmanaged boreal forests, especially those dominated by black spruce ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Picea mariana{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (Mill.) BSP) where constraints for regeneration differ from those found in more meridional regions. We aimed to evaluate conifer seedling density and dimensions, 10 years after the onset of a gradient of silvicultural treatments varying in harvesting intensities, and to identify the critical factors driving the regeneration process. Study blocks of even-aged black spruce stands in the eastern Canadian boreal forest were submitted to three variants of shelterwood harvesting: a seed-tree harvest, a clear-cut and an untreated control. Shelterwood and seed-tree harvesting were combined with spot scarification to promote regeneration. Shelterwood and seed-tree harvesting produced a density of conifer regeneration sufficient to maintain forest productivity, but they did not promote seedling growth. Black spruce was the predominant species in terms of regeneration density, with proportions 3–5× higher than that for balsam fir ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Abies balsamea{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (L.) Mill.). Ten years after treatment, seed-origin black spruce seedlings were abundant in skidding trails, while layers dominated the residual strips. Balsam fir density was not influenced by treatment nor by tree position relative to skidding trails. Balsam fir and black spruce had different responses to treatment in terms of height and diameter, the former exhibiting a better growth performance and larger diameter in the residual strips. Spot scarification created micro-sites that had a significant impact on the regeneration process. Overall, our results support that shelterwood and seed-tree harvesting combined with scarification enable adequate regeneration in black spruce stands, confirming these treatments as viable silvicultural alternatives to clear-cutting when required by sustainable forest management objectives.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Light, vegetation, and regeneration dynamics were monitored for 11 years as part of a partial harvesting experiment in an aspen-dominated boreal mixedwood stand in northeastern Ontario. The partial cut treatment removed 43\% of the original basal area in the overstory. An outbreak of forest tent caterpillar between years 3 and 5 further reduced the original overstory (about 22\%, mainly aspen) in the partial cut and uncut treatments. Clearcutting enhanced the density of hardwood regeneration but reduced the amount of conifer regeneration compared with the partial cut and uncut treatments. Reducing the overstory canopy increased the height growth of hardwood regeneration, density of speckled alder—the dominant tall shrub on site, and understory light levels but did not change the mean heights of conifer regeneration and shrubs. Harvesting generally did not affect the amounts of low understory vegetation, except mosses, which decreased significantly in cover in the clearcut. Although most of the conifer regeneration was still under hardwood regeneration and shrub layers, much of the advance conifer regeneration had reached over 4.0m (large sapling) between years 5 and 11 in both partial cut and uncut treatments. From years 5 to 11, the residual overstory inhibited hardwood regeneration and understory shrubs even more, reducing density, height, and number of hardwood in-growth into large saplings. The dynamics of regeneration and understory vegetation that we observed during the 11 years following harvesting, compounded by a forest tent caterpillar infestation, suggest that partial harvesting can promote the establishment and growth of shade-tolerant conifers (mainly balsam fir and some black spruce) and inhibit the development of shade-intolerant hardwood regeneration and understory vegetation. Future stand structure will likely consist mainly of hardwoods in the clearcut treatment, and mixed conifers and hardwoods in the partial cut and uncut treatments, with more hardwood components in the partial. Further monitoring is required to verify this premise.},

However, community composition may be driven by biotic or abiotic forces, and these vary with changes in habitat structure and resource supply associated with forest land use. To evaluate these changes, we compiled comprehensive data on the species composition of soil animal communities and environmental factors in forest types varying in land-use intensity in each of three regions in Germany, i.e., coniferous, young managed, old managed, and unmanaged beech forests. Coniferous forests featured high amounts of leaf litter and low microbial biomass concentrations contrasting in particular unmanaged beech forests. However, soil animal diversity and functional community composition differed little between forest types, indicating resilience against disturbance and forest land use. Structural equation modelling suggested that despite a significant influence of forest management on resource abundance and quality, the biomass of most soil fauna functional groups was not directly affected by forest management or resource abundance/quality, potentially because microorganisms hamper the propagation of nutrients to higher trophic levels. Instead, detritivore biomass depended heavily on soil pH. Macrofauna decomposers thrived at high pH, whereas mesofauna decomposers benefitted from low soil pH, but also from low biomass of macrofauna decomposers, potentially due to habitat modification by macrofauna decomposers. The strong influence of soil pH shows that decomposer communities are structured predominantly by regional abiotic factors exceeding the role of local biotic factors such as forest type.},

We comparedh litter invertebrates among samples of leaf–litter substrate samples in microcosms either with or without individual salamanders. We used mesh leaf–litter bags to quantify leaf–litter decomposition and temporal changes in invertebrate abundance and community composition during colonization of new litter by invertebrates. We report that substrates within microcosms with P. cinereus had more podomorphic Collembola, fewer enchytraeid worms and fewer macroinvertebrate detritivores than controls at the end of the 3 month experiment. Total invertebrate density, and densities of podomorphic Collembola and Acari increased more rapidly in litter bags within salamander microcosms than in controls. In contrast, entomobryid Collembola were fewer in litter bags in salamander microcosms in comparison to controls. However, salamanders had no effect on leaf–litter decomposition rates. We hypothesize that salamander predation enhanced microbidetritivore mesofauna densities by (1) reducing numbers of larger detritivores that compete with mesofauna, and/or by (2) providing a subsidy in the form of salamander feces that promoted growth of microﬂora. Further, we hypothesize that increases of mesofauna in salamander microcosms compensated for effects on litter decomposition that may have resulted from reductions in detritivorous macrofauna.},

	abstract = {The amount of carbon stored in deadwood is equivalent to about 8 per cent of the global forest carbon stocks1. The decomposition of deadwood is largely governed by climate2–5 with decomposer groups—such as microorganisms and insects—contributing to variations in the decomposition rates2,6,7. At the global scale, the contribution of insects to the decomposition of deadwood and carbon release remains poorly understood7. Here we present a field experiment of wood decomposition across 55 forest sites and 6 continents. We find that the deadwood decomposition rates increase with temperature, and the strongest temperature effect is found at high precipitation levels. Precipitation affects the decomposition rates negatively at low temperatures and positively at high temperatures. As a net effect—including the direct consumption by insects and indirect effects through interactions with microorganisms—insects accelerate the decomposition in tropical forests (3.9\% median mass loss per year). In temperate and boreal forests, we find weak positive and negative effects with a median mass loss of 0.9 per cent and −0.1 per cent per year, respectively. Furthermore, we apply the experimentally derived decomposition function to a global map of deadwood carbon synthesized from empirical and remote-sensing data, obtaining an estimate of 10.9 ± 3.2 petagram of carbon per year released from deadwood globally, with 93 per cent originating from tropical forests. Globally, the net effect of insects may account for 29 per cent of the carbon flux from deadwood, which suggests a functional importance of insects in the decomposition of deadwood and the carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {Background
Managing forests for timber while protecting wildlife habitat is of increasing concern. Amphibians may be particularly sensitive to forest management practices due to their unique biology; however, it is not clear how different species respond to timber harvest practices—particularly over longer time scales.

Methods
Here we report on the differential responses of two salamander species—the eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus Green) and the eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens Rafinesque)—to forest harvesting, by examining communities across a 25-year chronosequence of regenerating shelterwood harvests.

Results
Populations of both species were lowest immediately after harvest, but increased at substantially different rates. Red-backed salamander populations were highest in 20–25 year-old shelterwoods—significantly higher than in mature, unharvested, control (100–120 year old) stands. Eastern newt populations, however, were greatest in unharvested control stands and still had not recovered to population levels found in mature stands in the 25 years since harvest. Red-backed salamander abundances were strongly tied to stand age as well as abundance of decayed coarse woody debris, suggesting that timber harvests influence some wildlife species by affecting a suite of interacting habitat variables that change over time. In contrast, newt abundances were not directly related to stand age but were more related to downed wood and vegetation characteristics. Our results highlight markedly variable responses by two common salamander species to forest harvesting—species with markedly different life histories and reproductive patterns—and that time since harvest may be useful in predicting abundance.},

	abstract = {Woodland salamanders are among the most abundant vertebrate animals in temperate deciduous forests of eastern North America. Because of their abundance, woodland salamanders are responsible for the transformation of nutrients and translocation of energy between highly disparate levels of trophic organization: detrital food webs and high-order predators. However, the spatial extent of woodland salamanders’ role in the ecosystem is likely contingent upon the distribution of their biomass throughout the forest. We sought to determine if natural environmental gradients influence the fine-scale distribution and density of Southern Ravine Salamanders (Plethodon richmondi) and Cumberland Plateau Salamanders (P. kentucki). We addressed this objective by constructing occupancy, co-occurrence, and abundance models from temporally replicated surveys within an old-growth forest in the Cumberland Plateau region of Kentucky. We found that Plethodon richmondi had a more restricted fine-scale distribution than P. kentucki (mean occupancy probability [] = 0.737) and exhibited variable density, from {\textless}250 to {\textgreater}1000 individuals per hectare, associated with increased soil moisture and reduced solar exposure due to slope face. While more ubiquitously distributed ( = 0.95), P. kentucki density varied from {\textless}400 to {\textgreater}1,000 individuals per hectare and was inversely related to increased solar exposure from canopy disturbance and landscape convexity. Our data suggest co-occurrence patterns of P. richmondi and P. kentucki are influenced primarily by abiotic conditions within the forest, and that populations likely occur independently and without evidence of biotic interaction. Given the critical role that woodland salamanders play in the maintenance of forest health, regions that support large populations of woodland salamanders, such as those highlighted in this study—mesic forest stands on north-to-east facing slopes with dense canopy and abundant natural cover, may provide enhanced ecosystem services and support the stability of the total forest.},

Yet, the amount of time until salamander populations rebound and the factors limiting recovery after harvesting are unknown. We compared the effects of six oak regeneration practices to a control, representing a disturbance gradient from no treatment to silvicultural clearcut, on the relative abundance and reproductive demography of terrestrial salamanders through 13-years post-harvest. Following the experimental disturbance, relative abundance of terrestrial salamanders in treatments that opened the canopy were significantly and persistently lower than in either untreated control stands or midstory herbicide treatments. In general, this trend persisted through 9–13 years after treatment. Changes to demography of commonly captured salamanders varied by species, but Plethodon cinereus had a greater proportion of juveniles in unharvested treatments 7–13-years post-harvest, and Desmognathus ochrophaeus had a greater proportion of juveniles and a greater number of eggs/female in unharvested treatments 1–6-years post-harvest. Population modeling of P. cinereus indicated that adult survival had the greatest elasticity of the vital rates. Further, {\textgreater}60 years may be needed before P. cinereus reduced by the observed decline could reach pre-harvest levels of abundance. Of the treatments with canopy disturbance, the group selection harvest had the greatest abundances of salamanders 7–13-years post-harvest, but when coupled with future stand entries, the volume of wood fiber extracted, costs of harvesting, reduced sprouting of oaks, and soil disturbances, this method may not have the best balance of ecological and economic sustainability in central Appalachian hardwood forest.},

Forest fragments were relatively similar in vegeta tion and ranged in area from 0.5 to 21.5 ha. Samples were collected by pitfall traps from forest-fragment interior and edge and from the surrounding agro-urban environment. Abundance and species richness of carabids was lowest in the contiguous forest and highest in the fragment surroundings. Contiguous forest had none, large (9.6-21.5 ha) and medium-sized forest fragments (4.2-8.2 ha) a few, and small fragments (0.5-3.0 ha) several species typically found in the surrounding open habitats. High carabid diversity in the small fragments and in the surroundings was probably related to the higher vegetational diversity in such sites. High diversity of vegetation, in turn, was due to moderate human disturbance and effects of vegetation succession. Most of the abundant carabid species were non-randomly distributed among the habitat types. Some specialized forest carabids were caught exclusively in contiguous forest and only the most generalized forest species were obtained from small forest fragments. These results indicate that in order to preserve the integrity of forest arthropod faunas in urban areas it is essential to leave large, continuous forest tracts untouched to preserve specialist species and forest species assemblages.},

Many species that require habitat types found in interiors of fragments are threatened by fragmentation. On the other hand, the species composition of small fragments of habitat (up to a few hectares) is often altered by species invading from the surroundings. Recommendations for mitigating these adverse effects include maintenance of large habitat patches and connections between them. Furthermore, landscape homogenisation should be avoided by maintaining heterogeneity of habitat types. It appears that at least in the Northern Hemisphere there is enough data about carabids for them to be fruitfully used to signal changes in land use practices. Many carabid species have been classified as threatened. Maintenance of the red-listed carabids in the landscape requires species-specific or assemblage-specific measures.},

Numbers of salamanders were lower in three recently distrurbed habitats than in adjacent old-growth control stands. The frequency of above-ground activity by both species of salamanders was positively correlated with the density of understory vegetation and the depth of leaf litter. Small-scale habitat disruption associated with harvesting firewood increased the numbers of the terrestrial eft stage of the red-spotted newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) but had no effect on numbers of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus). A recently clearcut area had fewer red-backed salamanders than adjacent old-growth forest had, but the numbers of salamanders in a 60-year-old second-growth forest were indistinguishable from those in the adjacent old-growth forest.

Current reproductive success depended strongly on clutch size but not resource availability. Brood abandonment was higher among females with small clutches. Both brooding status and tail condition affected future reproductive potential. Brooding females gained less mass and produced fewer new ova than nonbrooders. Tail loss resulted in increased tail regeneration but decreased production of new ova. These strong main effects were consistent between years, despite differences in experimental protocol and limited sample sizes. Food levels affected female growth only in interaction with brooding status, and these effects differed between years. Gain in mass was affected by this interaction more strongly in 1993 than in 1994, and tail regeneration was only affected in 1994.

	abstract = {Two species of salamander, Plethodon cinereus, and Plethodon hoffmani were used in experiments designed to test the hypothesis that food is the object of competition. Plethodon hoffmani occurs in the Appalachian Ridge and Valley Province where it appears to exclude the closely related and contiguously allopatric P. cinereus. Detailed field observations and a laboratory experiment confirm Jaeger's (1972) hypothesis that the food of salamanders could be limited in availability during dry weather and suggest that the cause of the low availability is the reduced mobility of the salamanders rather than a reduced food supply. However, because stomach content data and behavioral observations indicate that salamanders do not forage when the surface is dry, it was reasoned that food competition could occur under only two restricted conditions: (1) when more than one animal is isolated under damp refugia, such as rocks and logs, during dry weather, and (2) when many animals emerge onto the surface to forage when wet weather follows a prolonged dry period. Empirical evidence suggests that salamanders do not clump in refugia as the habitat dries out and that they do not surface simultaneously to forage after a dry period. Thus, even though food is periodically unavailable, the staggered feeding schedule prevents the density of salamanders from ever reaching competitive levels. Interference mechanisms are not ruled out as mechanisms of the observed spacing patterns. Competition for space is suggested as an alternative to the food competition hypothesis.},

The sample from the whole snow-free season comprised 2405 individuals of twenty-two species. Each of the most numerous species (Pterostichus oblongopunctatus (F.), Calathus micropterus (Dft.), Leistus terminatus (Hellw. in Pz.), Notiophilus biguttatus (F.) and Cychrus caraboides (L.)), was non-randomly distributed and formed aggregations within the site of c. 1.3 ha in area. Although the five species occurred in every microhabitat defined in the plot, four of them (N. biguttatus was an exception) were more abundantly found in certain microhabitat types than in the others. In addition to vegetation around the traps, the numbers of Formica ants in the traps correlated with the numbers of carabids caught, mostly negatively. The considerable variation in catches and species richness among single traps and among blocks of 16 traps tended to even out, when larger subsamples were taken from the total pool (blocks of 48 traps). The distribution patterns observed within the plot were compared to a reference data set from similar habitat in the same region. Species distributions among microhabitats were slightly different in the reference set and the predictive success was relatively poor, probably due to different scales of study in the two data sets. Variation in species distribution in the two spatial scales studied (within a habitat patch and among them) is supposedly due to different factors. Although no direct evidence is available from our study, area, we suggest that active microhabitat selection explains the small-scale distribution within the study plot, whereas dynamics of local populations, influenced by regional-scale differences in habitat composition, are the most likely explanation for the distribution patterns among habitat patches.},

	abstract = {: We studied the occurrence of carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in boreal forest fragments, their edges, and adjacent clearcuts in central Finland. Beetles were collected with pitfall traps along transects extending 60 m from the edge into clearcuts and 60 m into forest interior. Our main findings were that (1) species richness was significantly higher in the clearcut than in the forest fragments, (2) clearcuts hosted many open-habitat species, which increased overall species richness in these sites, (3) carabid assemblages in the edges were more similar to forest assemblages than to those found in the clearcuts, (4) no edge specialists were found, and (5) open-habitat species did not penetrate into the forest fragments from the clearcut. Because forest specialists occurred all the way to the edge on the forest side, it seems that edge effects per se do not adversely affect these species, at least in the short term. In the long term, however, habitat conditions in the edges may deteriorate for interior species because of trees falling over in strong winds, thereby reducing the size of the fragments and widening the edge zone.




Resumen: Estudiamos la presencia de escarabajos carabidos (Coleoptera, Carabidae) en fragmentos de un bosque boreal, de sus bordes y de zonas taladas adyacentes en Finlandia central. Los escarabajos fueron colectados usando trampas cubiertas a lo largo de transectos que se extendian desde 60 m del borde hacia el area de tala y 60 m hacia el interior del bosque. Nuestros resultados principales fueron: (1) la riqueza de especies fue significativamente mayor en la zona talada que en los fragmentos de bosque, (2) las zonas taladas hospedaron muchas especies de habitat abierto, lo cual incremento la riqueza general de especies en estos sitios, (3) los ensamblajes de carabidos en los bordes fueron mas similares a los ensamblajes del bosque, que aquellos en las zonas taladas, (4) no se encontraron especialistas de borde, y (5) las especies de habitat abierto no penetraron de las zonas taladas hacia los fragmentos de bosque. Debido a que los especialistas de bosque aparecieron a todo lo largo del borde en el lado del bosque, aparentemente los efectos de borde en si no afectan adversamente a estas especies, al menos a corto plazo. Sin embargo, a largo plazo las condiciones del habitat en los bordes podrian deteriorar para las especies del interior, debido a la caida de arboles ocasionada por vientos fuertes, lo cual reduce el tamano de los fragmentos, ampliando la zona de borde.},

Most species were known to have wide geographic distributions in Canada and Alaska but many species seemed to respond to disturbance on a site-specific basis. Contrary to findings of similar studies, no species could be characterized as “mature-forest specialists”, or “forest generalists”. Forest patches and edge habitats immediately inside the forest canopy contained assemblages more closely related to mature forest than to cleared areas. Harvested areas with patches yielded catches distinct from typical clearcuts, based primarily on changes in abundance of one common species. Climatic regimes and landscape disturbance levels were the two important factors distinguishing our study from others, and we have suggested that these may influence the degree to which patches are an effective conservation tool.},

In contrast, both total spider abundance and species richness were significantly higher in thinned stands. Hunting spiders within the families Lycosidae and Gnaphosidae, and the funnel web-building Dictynidae were captured more often in thinned stands while sheet web spiders within Linyphiidae and Hahniidae were more abundant in unthinned stands.

	abstract = {Climate change is increasingly impacting temperate forest ecosystems and many forest herbs might be unable to track the changing climate due to dispersal limitation. Forest herbs with a low adaptive capacity may therefore benefit from conservation strategies that mitigate dispersal limitation and evolutionary constraints, such as assisted migration. However, assisted migration strategies rarely consider evolutionary constraints of potential source populations that may jeopardize their success. In cases where climate adaptation is overshadowed by competing evolutionary processes, assisted migration is unlikely to support adaptation to future climates. Using a combination of population and landscape genomic analyses, we disentangled local adaptation drivers and quantified the adaptability and vulnerability to climate change of the self-incompatible deciduous forest herb Primula elatior. Southern populations displayed a sharp genetic turnover and a considerable amount of local adaptation under diversifying selection was discovered. However, most of the outlier loci could not be linked to climate variables (71\%) and were likely related to other local adaptation drivers, such as photoperiodism. Furthermore, specific adaptations to climate extremes, such as drought stress, could not be detected. This is in line with the typical occurrence of forest herbs in buffered climatic conditions, which can be expected to reduce selection pressures imposed by climate. Finally, populations in the south of the distribution area had increased sensitivity to climate change due to a reduced adaptive capacity and a moderate genetic offset, while central European populations were sensitive due to a high genetic offset. We conclude that assisted migration from southern source populations could bear significant risk due to nonclimatic maladaptation and a low adaptive capacity. Regional admixture and restoration of ecological connectivity to increase the adaptive capacity, and assisted range expansion to suitable habitat in the north might be more appropriate mitigation strategies.},

	abstract = {Résumé
Soil is the habitat of plant roots and the home of numerous microflora, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and blue-green algae, and a host of animals from unicellular protozoans to small vertebrates. Simple communities of soil organisms, present from the earliest stages of forest soil genesis, become more complex and grow to astronomical numbers in mature forest soils. Here, they are essential for the maintenance and productivity of these soils, which unlike agricultural systems, generally receive less mechanical treatments and chemical inputs. The soil microflora and fauna complement each other in the comminution of litter, mineralization of essential plant nutrients, and conservation of these nutrients within the soil system. Harvesting directly affects these processes through the reduction and redistribution of organic matter, compaction, changes in plant cover, and modification of microclimate, all of which affect the distribution, composition and activity of the soil biological communities. Although most information is available for clearcut forests, the limited data from other systems indicate that severity of impacts of forest harvesting practices generally follow the sequence: clearcuts{\textgreater}shelterwood systems{\textgreater}extended rotation systems. However, all practices generally affect soil organisms over the short term. Changes over the longer-term are less obvious because of gradual recovery of most biological components with canopy closure. Long-term impacts are more difficult to interpret because these are often influenced by natural changes in population dynamics of soil organisms with forest succession, drought, and the invasion of exotic species. Responses are complex, with various groups being affected differently. Even within a taxon, individual species may behave differently. Although the relationships among floral composition, faunal diversity and sustained soil fertility are not always clear, there are indications that a simplified soil biological system will adversely affect nutrient cycling, tree growth, and forest health. Decomposition rate is generally positively correlated with faunal biomass, and a diverse fauna is required for interacting with microorganisms to enhance microbial diversity. Also, feeding on microflora by the fauna concurrently controls certain plant pathogens. Destruction of mycorrhizae, essential for the establishment of coniferous seedlings, can lead to serious reforestation problems. It is therefore prudent to discourage any qualitative or quantitative changes in the soil biota. Concepts in ‘new forestry’ attempt to mitigate against adverse affects of conventional forest harvesting practices on soil organisms by maintaining plant biodiversity, minimizing soil compaction, avoiding extreme microclimatic conditions, providing refugia for re-colonization by the biota, and directly introducing desirable microflora and fauna.},

	abstract = {Evidence is mounting that extinctions are altering key processes important to the productivity and sustainability of Earth’s ecosystems. Further species loss will accelerate change in ecosystem processes, but it is unclear how these effects compare to the direct effects of other forms of environmental change that are both driving diversity loss and altering ecosystem function. Here we use a suite of meta-analyses of published data to show that the effects of species loss on productivity and decomposition—two processes important in all ecosystems—are of comparable magnitude to the effects of many other global environmental changes. In experiments, intermediate levels of species loss (21–40\%) reduced plant production by 5–10\%, comparable to previously documented effects of ultraviolet radiation and climate warming. Higher levels of extinction (41–60\%) had effects rivalling those of ozone, acidification, elevated CO2 and nutrient pollution. At intermediate levels, species loss generally had equal or greater effects on decomposition than did elevated CO2 and nitrogen addition. The identity of species lost also had a large effect on changes in productivity and decomposition, generating a wide range of plausible outcomes for extinction. Despite the need for more studies on interactive effects of diversity loss and environmental changes, our analyses clearly show that the ecosystem consequences of local species loss are as quantitatively significant as the direct effects of several global change stressors that have mobilized major international concern and remediation efforts.},

	abstract = {Many indicators and criteria have been proposed to assess the sustainable management of forests but their scientific validity remains uncertain. Because the effects of forest disturbances (such as logging) are often specific to particular species, sites, landscapes, regions and forest types, management “shortcuts” such as indicator species, focal species and threshold levels of vegetation cover may be of limited generic value. We propose an alternative approach based on a set of five guiding principles for biodiversity conservation that are broadly applicable to any forested area: (1) the maintenance of connectivity; (2) the maintenance of landscape heterogeneity; (3) the maintenance of stand structural complexity; and (4) the maintenance of aquatic ecosystem integrity; (5) the use of natural disturbance regimes to guide human disturbance regimes. We present a checklist of measures for forest biodiversity conservation that reflects the multi-scaled nature of conservation approaches on forested land. At the regional scale, management should ensure the establishment of large ecological reserves. At the landscape scale, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) protected areas within production forests; (2) buffers for aquatic ecosystems; (3) appropriately designed and located road networks; (4) the careful spatial and temporal arrangement of harvest units; and (5) appropriate fire management practices. At the stand level, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) the retention of key elements of stand structural complexity (e.g., large living and dead trees with hollows, understorey thickets, and large fallen logs); (2) long rotation times (coupled with structural retention at harvest); (3) silvicultural systems alternative to traditional high impact ones (e.g., clearcutting in some forest types); and (4) appropriate fire management practices and practices for the management of other kinds of disturbances. Although the general ecological principles and associated checklist are intuitive, data to evaluate the effectiveness of many specific on-the-ground management actions are limited. Considerable effort is needed to adopt adaptive management “natural experiments” and monitoring to: (1) better identify the impacts of logging operations and other kinds of management activities on biodiversity, and; (2) quantify the effectiveness of impact mitigation strategies; and (3) identify ways to improve management practices.},

	abstract = {Logging is the main human disturbance impacting biodiversity in forest ecosystems. However, the impact of forest harvesting on biodiversity is modulated by abiotic conditions through complex relationships that remain poorly documented. Therefore, the interplay between forest management and climate change can no longer be ignored. Our aim was to study the expected long-term variations in the assemblage of bird and beetle communities following modifications in forest management under different climate change scenarios. We developed species distribution models to predict the occurrence of 88 species of birds and beetles in eastern Canadian boreal forests over the next century. We simulated three climate scenarios (baseline, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) under which we varied the level of harvesting. We also analyzed the regional assemblage dissimilarity by decomposing it into balanced variations in species occupancy and occupancy gradient. We predict that forest harvesting will alter the diversity by increasing assemblage dissimilarity under all the studied climate scenarios, mainly due to species turnover. Species turnover intensity was greater for ground-dwelling beetles, probably because they have lower dispersal capacity than flying beetles or birds. A good dispersal capacity allows species to travel more easily between ecosystems across the landscape when they search for suitable habitats after a disturbance. Regionally, an overall increase in the probability of occupancy is projected for bird species, whereas a decrease is predicted for beetles, a variation that could reflect differences in ecological traits between taxa. Our results further predict a decrease in the number of species that increase their occupancy after harvest under the most severe climatic scenario for both taxa. We anticipate that under severe climate change, increasing forest disturbance will be detrimental to beetles associated with old forests but also with young forests after disturbances.},

A 115-year-old stand of mixed Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies in central Sweden was clear-cut in March 1999. In June 1999, two plots on the clear-cut were burnt and two plots were left unburnt according to an experimental design with two blocks. Two plots of adjacent uncut forest were used as controls. The burning combusted the ground vegetation and the upper half of the 6-cm thick organic layer. In comparison with the unburnt clear-cut, burning decreased the abundances of Collembola, Protura, Mesostigmata, Araneae and Diptera larvae throughout the 5-year period, whereas Enchytraeidae, Lumbricidae, Oribatida, Prostigmata, Astigmata and Tardigrada decreased immediately after the fire but showed tendencies of recovery. Burning also decreased species richness. The majority of the species still absent after 5 years was surface-living species. Even animals with good ability to disperse (Diptera, Coleoptera and Araneae) had not recovered, which indicates a change of habitat or lack of food. Clear-cut burning was particularly detrimental to fungivores and predators, whereas microbi-detritivores and herbivores were less affected. Prescribed burning, which is considered to increase aboveground biodiversity, dramatically reduced the soil fauna species richness for at least 5 years and did not add any species to those already present in the forest or clear-cut.},

Soil processes were examined by monitoring soil solution chemistry collected using zero-tension lysimeters from the Oa, Bh and Bs horizons at three sites along an elevational/vegetation gradient. Whole-tree clear-cutting created a severe ecosystem disturbance leading to leaching losses of nutrients from the soil profile, increased acidification, and elevated concentrations of Al-ions in soil solutions and streamwater. The response was driven by the process of nitrification that led to production of nitric acid in both the forest floor and mineral soil horizons. This acidity was largely neutralized by release and leaching of basic cations and inorganic monomeric Al-ions leaching with the NO3-ions. The major source of nutrient loss was from the forest floor. The chemical response to the clear-cut was most intense during the second year following the treatment and declined to near reference concentrations in 4–5 years. High elevation sites showed the greatest response to disturbance and the slowest recovery of soil solution concentrations to pre-cut concentrations. Shallow soils and a slower recovery of vegetation at the upper elevation sites were the primary factors contributing to the enhanced disturbance and delayed recovery (and enhanced response to disturbance in the upper elevation sites).},

A total of 41,858 salamanders representing ten species were captured under artificial coverboards over this period with eastern red-back (Plethodon cinereus) and zigzag (Plethodon dorsalis) salamanders dominating. No significant declines occurred in the first three years following harvest, but salamander captures declined in the 4–6 and 7–11 year periods in clearcuts and patch cuts, and no signs of post-harvest recovery were found. Rapid vegetation recovery and high volumes of coarse woody debris (CWD) following harvest likely protected the microclimate used by salamanders; when CWD levels dropped 4–6 years after harvest, a corresponding decline in salamander captures occurred. These years also corresponded to a regional drought that likely increased temperature and decreased moisture in harvest openings, further impacting terrestrial salamanders. Neither the first nor second shelterwood harvests produced declines in salamanders, suggesting that canopy retention could prevent declines due to changing microclimate or drought. Our results highlight the need to consider compound effects of disturbances such as drought and canopy loss and the importance of long-term salamander monitoring following timber harvest to capture lagged effects and eventual recovery.},

	abstract = {Questions about the compatibility of forest harvesting practices and conservation of biological diversity are largely driven by concerns that habitat quality for many species may be degraded in intensively managed forest landscapes. We review the literature on relationships between common forest harvesting practices and the distribution and abundance of amphibians, a group that has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of their potential ecological importance in forest ecosystems and because of reports of widespread population declines. Clear-cut harvesting generally has negative short-term impacts on local amphibian populations, especially salamanders. An analysis of the results of 18 studies that examined the effects of clear-cutting on amphibians yielded a 3.5-fold median difference in abundance of amphibians on controls over clear-cuts. However, research on the influence of forest age suggests that the long-term effects of forest harvesting on amphibians are variable, and for many species these effects can be mitigated if regeneration practices leave adequate microhabitat structure intact. In contrast, long-term effects can be significant in forest plantations, which are often associated with intensive site preparations and stand management practices that modify levels of coarse woody debris and other microhabitats. Other forest practices reviewed for their effect on amphibians include prescribed fire, logging roads, and streamside harvesting. We discuss problems commonly encountered in the experimental design and measurement of forest amphibian populations, including a notable lack of pretreatment data, and outline several aspects of amphibian–forestry relationships in need of further research. Management recommendations relevant to conserving upland and riparian zone amphibian habitat during forest harvesting are offered.Key words: amphibians, clear-cutting, coarse woody debris, forest management, logging roads, plantations, prescribed fire, riparian, succession.},

	abstract = {Recent research in northern Europe has revised many long-held conceptions of the complexity of forest ecosystems and their natural structure and dynamics. The unveiling of the picture of natural characteristics of forest ecosystem structure and dynamics reveals much more diversity than its traditional complement, highlighting the importance of non–stand-replacing disturbances and the associated heterogeneous and dynamic stand and landscape structures. This increasing detail is a reflection of a fundamental change in the ecological understanding of forests as complex ecosystems. In particular, the generalization that the boreal forest is regulated by fierce stand-replacing disturbances, leading to the dominance of even-aged stand successions, has been disproved. However, this misconception has, until now, been repeated and used to legitimize the dominant practice of clear-cutting as a nature-based way to manage the forest. The practical conclusion of this review paper is that the dominating forest management model in North European boreal forests, which is based on the clear-cut harvesting of timber and growing of even-aged stands, is in contradiction with the variable and complex characteristics of the disturbance-succession cycle observed in naturally dynamic forests with negligible human impact. As a consequence, the structural variation of the boreal forest under management has been grossly truncated compared with its natural range. Because of this, and due to the scarcity of protection areas in many regions of northern Europe, it is not likely that the conservation of native biodiversity and ecological sustainability will be attained, assuming that the model of forest management remains unchanged. Thus, there is a strong incentive for change in the prevailing forest management model toward one that is based on natural ecosystem dynamics and an understanding of forests as complex systems.},

	abstract = {Sustainable forest management (SFM) is many things to many people – yet a common thread is the production of forest goods and services for the present and future generations. The promise of sustainability is rooted in the two premises; first that ecosystems have the potential to renew themselves and second that economic activities and social perceptions or values that define human interaction with the environment are choices that can be modified to ensure the long term productivity and health of the ecosystem. SFM addresses a great challenge in matching the increasing demands of a growing human population while maintaining ecological functions of healthy forest ecosystems. This paper does not seek to define SFM, but rather provides analyses of key indicators for the national-scale enabling environment to gain a global insight into progress in implementing enabling and implementing SFM at the national and operational levels. Analyses of the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 (FRA) country report data are used to provide insights into the current state of progress in implementing the enabling conditions for SFM. Over 2.17 billion ha of the world’s forest area are predicted by governments to remain in permanent forest land use, of which some 1.1 billion ha are covered by all of the SFM tools investigated in FRA 2015. At the global scale, SFM-related policies and regulations are reported to be in place on 97\% of global forest area. While the number of countries with national forest inventories has increased over that past ten years from 48 to 112, only 37\% of forests in low income countries are covered by forest inventories. Forest management planning and monitoring of plans has increased substantially as has forest management certification, which exceeded a total of over 430 million ha in 2014. However, 90\% of internationally verified certification is in the boreal and temperate climatic domains – only 6\% of permanent forests in the tropical domain have been certified as of 2014. Results show that more work is needed to expand the extent and depth of work on establishing the enabling conditions that support SFM over the long term and suggests where those needs are greatest.},

	abstract = {Managing for stand structural complexity in northern hardwood forests has been proposed as a method for promoting microhabitat characteristics important to eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus). We evaluated the effects of alternate, structure-based silvicultural systems on red-backed salamander populations at two research sites in northwestern Vermont. Treatments included two uneven-aged approaches (single-tree selection and group-selection) and one unconventional approach, termed “structural complexity enhancement” (SCE), that promotes development of late-successional structure, including elevated levels of coarse woody debris (CWD). Treatments were applied to 2ha units and were replicated two to four times depending on treatment. We surveyed red-backed salamanders with a natural cover search method of transects nested within vegetation plots 1 year after logging. Abundance estimates corrected for detection probability were calculated from survey data with a binomial mixture model. Abundance estimates differed between study areas and were influenced by forest structural characteristics. Model selection was conducted using Akaike Information Criteria, corrected for over-dispersed data and small sample size (QAICc). We found no difference in abundance as a response to treatment as a whole, suggesting that all of the uneven-aged silvicultural systems evaluated can maintain salamander populations after harvest. However, abundance was tied to specific structural habitat attributes associated with study plots within treatments. The most parsimonious model of habitat covariates included site, relative density of overstory trees, and density of more-decayed and less-decayed downed CWD. Abundance responded positively to the density of downed, well-decayed CWD and negatively to the density of poorly decayed CWD and to overstory relative density. CWD volume was not a strong predictor of salamander abundance. We conclude that structural complexity enhancement and the two uneven-aged approaches maintained important microhabitat characteristics for red-backed salamander populations in the short term. Over the long-term, given decay processes as a determinant of biological availability, forestry practices such as SCE that enhance CWD availability and recruitment may result in associated population responses.},

Baker (10) …the existing level of knowledge about forests is inadequate to develop sound forest management policies. National Research Council (114) Over the past two decades forestry in the United States has diverged into two approaches with quite different objectives and scientific priorities. The management focus of most industrial lands is on increasing productivity of wood fiber via plantations and various cultural tools, especially genetic selection, fertilization, and control of noncrop vegetation. Federal forest management has shifted from a similar focus to greater emphasis on protecting diversity and water. Issues of long-term sustainability are important regardless of ownership. Science has played and continues to play a fundamental role in all aspects. Selection for fast-growing genotypes has increased yields on the order of 10\% to 20\% depending on species. Fertilization often increases growth significantly but responses are variable and difficult to predict. Significant questions remain concerning the sustainability of intensive forestry, particularly when practiced over wide areas. Soils are heavily impacted by some harvesting practices, and the degree to which damage can be repaired by fertilizers is an important scientific issue. Intensive forestry often results in increased pest problems. In at least one case (fusiform rust in southern pines), a pest has been contained by selecting resistant cultivars, a situation that may or may not be evolutionarily stable. Species diversity is clearly reduced under intensive management, raising questions about the functional role of species with no commercial value. Many of the questions facing forestry science—particularly those dealing with the relation between complexity and function—are precisely the ones confronting basic ecology. Over the past decade scientists have labored to develop ecosystem-based management approaches that maintain system complexity and function, and scientists have increasingly played nontraditional roles at the interface between biology, sociology, and policy.},

In this study, by using a global meta-analysis of 64 observations from 29 peer-reviewed publications over the last 30 years, we elucidated how forest harvest impacted soil N2O flux and related soil properties. Intensive forest harvest significantly increased soil N2O flux with a mean effect size of 0.85 and the increase was associated with elevated soil temperature, increased concentration of NO3−-N and decreased soil pH. The effect on soil N2O flux lasted for around six years, and soil N2O emission depended on existing forest types in the late stage (the recovery period {\textgreater}6 years) after harvest. Forest harvest clearly increased soil N2O flux, with effect size ranging 0.73–2.12, in broadleaf forests but did not significantly affect it in coniferous and mixed broadleaf-conifer forests. In addition, the time required for the complete recovery from harvest in terms of N2O flux was difficult to define because of the scarcity of long-term experiments. Overall, this study provides the first formal global-scale assessment on how forest harvest intensity, forest types and the time since harvest affect soil N2O flux. The findings of this study help to narrow the knowledge gap regarding the effect of forest harvest on soil N2O flux, and to facilitate decision making to decrease soil N2O emission post forest harvest.},

We argue that the next generation of forestry practices need to understand and mimic natural disturbance dynamics much better than the present ones. Of particular importance is the fact that most species in European forests have evolved in forests that were to a large extent influenced by large grazers, first by megaherbivores and later, in historic times, by domestic animals. We highlight several areas where new knowledge and management tools are urgently needed: (i) How do species survive and adapt to the natural disturbance regimes in different regions and forest types? (ii) How can new and imaginative forest management practices be devised that take natural disturbance regimes into account? (iii) How does forest biodiversity affect ecosystem function and stability in a changing world, in particular in the light of predicted climate changes?

	abstract = {A stand of forest trees is quite tangible to us; however, many of the processes that shape the biological diversity of that stand are invisible because they relate to events that have happened during some distant past or because they occur in the landscape beyond the area of forest we can see. Some scientists have called this phenomena ‘the invisible present’ and the ‘invisible place’ (Magnuson 1990, Swanson and Sparks 1990) meaning that the wrong temporal and spatial perspectives can produce erroneous conclusions. Humans and their management systems have typically perceived ecosystems at short distances and over short time frames. However, processes such as dispersal, disturbance, and succession, which control the state and dynamics of ecosystems and biological diversity, operate across a much wider range of spatial and temporal scales. This chapter is about seeing these large-scale temporal and spatial phenomena and understanding how they relate to the conservation of biological diversity.Understanding the dynamics and heterogeneity of natural forest landscapes has become very important as management objectives for forests increasingly include the maintenance of biological diversity. Using natural or semi-natural ecosystems as a template for management is quite challenging, requiring understanding not only the patterns of forest change, but also the processes that underlie them. Recent advances in theory and empirical studies of vegetation ecology and landscape ecology indicate that if goals of maintaining biological diversity across landscapes are to be achieved in the long run, then management and conservation need to broaden their focus to include variability, scale, pattern, disturbance, and biotic processes.},

	abstract = {Based on an inventory of two permanent plots of 10 ha each, the main structural differences between a virgin beech forest in the Uholka-Massiv in Transcarpathia, Ukraine, and the Sihlwald, an – until recently – managed beech forest near Zurich, Switzerland, were analysed. In this paper, first results are presented and discussed. The diameter distribution of the Sihlwald showed the typical structure of a two-layered forest, whereas that of Uholka indicated a very uneven-aged structure with a more-or-less even distribution of trees over a large diameter range. Apart from the top height and the number of trees, which did not differ significantly between the two sites, all measured parameters such as basal area, standing volume and stand density index were higher in Uholka than in the Sihlwald. The volume of deadwood was about 14 times higher in the virgin than in the managed forest. Variability of most of the measured parameters between subplots of 0.25 ha was higher in Uholka than in the Sihlwald. Regeneration density is considered sufficient on both sites. Small-scale regeneration methods, such as progressive felling by small groups and single tree or group selection systems, "imitate" best the natural regeneration processes in undis-turbed beech forests. The maintenance of a certain amount of admixed species needs silvicultural interventions as beech is very dominant on its optimum sites.},

	abstract = {Studies of the effects of timber harvest on forest insect communities have rarely considered how disturbance from a range of harvest levels interacts with temporal variation in species diversity to affect community resistance to change. Here I report the results of a landscape-scale, before-and-after, treatment–control experiment designed to test how communities of forest Lepidoptera experience (1) changes in species richness and composition and (2) shifts in species dominance one year after logging. I sampled Lepidoptera from 20 forest stands allocated to three harvest treatments (control, even-aged shelterwood or clearcuts, and uneven-aged group selection cuts) within three watersheds at Morgan-Monroe State Forest, Indiana, USA. Moths were sampled from all forest stands one year prior to harvest in 2007 and immediately post-harvest in 2009. Species composition was most significantly affected by temporal variation between years, although uneven-aged management also caused significant changes in lepidopteran community structure. Furthermore, species richness of Lepidoptera was higher in 2007 compared to 2009 across all watersheds and forest stands. The decrease in species richness between years, however, was much larger in even-aged and uneven-aged management units compared to the control. Furthermore, matrix stands within the even-aged management unit demonstrated the highest resistance to species loss within any management unit. Species dominance was highly resistant to effects of timber harvest, with pre- and post-harvest values for Simpson diversity nearly invariant. Counter to prediction, however, the suite of dominant taxa differed dramatically among the three management units post-harvest. My results suggest that temporal variation may have strong interactions with timber harvest, precipitating loss of nearly 50\% species richness from managed stands regardless of harvest level. Even-aged management, however, appeared to leave the smallest “footprint” on moth communities. Timber harvest also created greater heterogeneity in species dominance among management units, suggesting that forest watersheds may diverge in post-harvest recovery transients relative to unlogged watersheds in Morgan-Monroe State Forest. Because moth communities appear to be highly sensitive to group-selection cuts, shelterwood cuts, and clearcuts, it will be important to retain unlogged concessions within management units to resist landscape-level loss of Lepidoptera.},

	abstract = {Timber harvesting has been shown to have both positive and negative effects on forest dwelling species. We examined the immediate effects of timber harvests (clearcuts and group selection openings) on ectotherm behavior, using the eastern box turtle as a model. We monitored the movement and thermal ecology of 50 adult box turtles using radiotelemetry from May–October for two years prior to, and two years following scheduled timber harvests in the Central Hardwoods Region of the U.S. Annual home ranges (7.45 ha, 100\% MCP) did not differ in any year or in response to timber harvests, but were 33\% larger than previous estimates (range 0.47–187.67 ha). Distance of daily movements decreased post-harvest (from 22 m±1.2 m to 15 m±0.9 m) whereas thermal optima increased (from 23±1°C to 25±1°C). Microclimatic conditions varied by habitat type, but monthly average temperatures were warmer in harvested areas by as much as 13°C. Animals that used harvest openings were exposed to extreme monthly average temperatures (∼40°C). As a result, the animals made shorter and more frequent movements in and out of the harvest areas while maintaining 9\% higher body temperatures. This experimental design coupled with radiotelemetry and behavioral observation of a wild ectotherm population prior to and in response to anthropogenic habitat alteration is the first of its kind. Our results indicate that even in a relatively contiguous forested landscape with small-scale timber harvests, there are local effects on the thermal ecology of ectotherms. Ultimately, the results of this research can benefit the conservation and management of temperature-dependent species by informing effects of timber management across landscapes amid changing climates.},

	abstract = {Identifying the effect of timber harvest on plant and animal communities is important for managers seeking to conserve ecosystem function. Timber harvest affects many forest species, including small mammals, a key component of forest food webs. We studied short-term responses of several common small-mammal species to clearcutting and shelterwood harvest in hardwood forests of southern Indiana. We trapped small mammals at 32 forest stands for 2 years before harvest. Each stand then received a timber harvest treatment: either the creation of a 0.4-, 2-, or 4-ha clearcut opening, shelterwood harvest, or no harvest. Following harvest, we trapped small mammals for 3 additional years. We estimated abundance from capture data and compared estimates before and after harvests using an N-mixture model fit in a Bayesian framework. Small mammals in our study differed in their responses to timber harvest. Eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) increased in all clearcut opening sizes, whereas white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) were less abundant in larger clearcuts. The first stage (midstory removal) of a 3-stage shelterwood harvest had no impact on the small-mammal community. Mast production influenced small-mammal populations independent of silvicultural treatments. In the years immediately following harvest, managers can expect populations of common small-mammal species to increase or remain unchanged in small clearcut openings, but some species decline in larger openings that reduce the edge to interior ratio of habitat created. The phased shelterwood harvest system in which habitat is altered over a longer period may be ideal for maintaining existing small-mammal populations. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

Cerulean Warblers occurred in greater abundance at study sites that received even aged harvests than in uneven aged harvested stands based on point - count surveys. Cerulean Warblers were attracted to areas with large canopy gaps resulting from even-aged harvests. Territory sizes were not significantly smaller after harvest treatments. Cerulean Warbler territories on harvested and control sites were clustered, closer to roads and streams, and on steeper slopes with an eastern aspect compared to random sites. Our relative abundance estimates suggested that Cerulean Warblers responded positively to some types of forest treatments during the 2 y post harvest period.},

Forest management practices alter forests, impacting species differently and presumably affecting bat activity. Application of forest management that promotes species-specific bat conservation requires further understanding of bat response to silvicultural practices. We surveyed timber harvest treatments on two Indiana State Forests to compare bat activity across forest management treatments, in forests adjacent to harvests, and at locations across the harvest-forest gradient from May to July in 2013 and 2014. We used Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter SM2BAT+ detectors and Kaleidoscope Pro analysis software to survey bats in relation to four treatment types: clear cut, patch cut, shelterwood preparatory cut, and intact forest. Detectors were deployed at two points within each treatment and three points on the forested periphery of treatments and recorded for three consecutive nights. We examined bat activity using N-mixture models that estimate abundance and probability of detection for an open population and used Akaike's Information Criterion to select the best models. Based on identification of acoustic calls, eastern red bats and hoary bats were more active in harvest treatments than control treatments. Big brown, eastern red, and tri-colored bats were most active at harvest edges. Northern long-eared and Indiana/little brown bats were most active at harvest edges and in adjacent forest and hoary bats were most active at harvest centers. Differences in bat activity across these managed forests suggest bat assemblages benefit from management that employs an array of silvicultural methods, provides edge habitat, and maintains adjacent forest stands. Our results can be used to predict effects of forest management practices on species-specific bat activity to maximize bat usage of forests.},

	abstract = {Green-tree retention cutting (GTR) is a modification of traditional clear-cutting, aimed at better consideration of biodiversity. We reviewed 214 North American and European studies to answer whether, and under which circumstances, GTR meets its objectives: ‘lifeboats’ species over the regeneration phase, provides microhabitats for old-forest species in re-established forest stands and for disturbance-phase species on the recent cuts, and enhances species’ dispersal by increasing landscape connectivity. To answer these questions is complicated, partly because the target taxa differ regionally and due to research biases: 81\% of the studies have been carried out in North America, 82\% have been short term, and the objective of improving landscape connectivity has not been studied. A meta-analysis of GTR effects on species richness and abundance of different taxa indicated no negative responses, but birds and ectomycorrhizal fungi benefited most. Compared with clear-cutting, GTR lowered the harvest-related loss of populations or individuals in 72\% of studies, and it nearly always improved the habitat for disturbance-phase insects and birds on the cuts and for forest species in the regenerated stand. Lifeboating was most successful for ectomycorrhizal fungi, epiphytic lichens and small ground-dwelling animals, and least successful for bryophytes and vascular plants. Retention tree species always contributed to the success of GTR, followed by tree density (65\% of cases) and the spatial arrangement of the trees (50\%); the influence of forest type is likely, but insufficiently studied. Ectomycorrhizal fungi, epiphytes, birds, and wood-dependent beetles may be suitable indicator taxa for measuring the success of GTR. For future research, we encourage clearly objective oriented studies of relevant taxa, spatially explicit landscape perspectives, and long-term (including retrospective) studies.},

The main gap effects did not increase with gap area. Nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) and ANOSIM tests showed that all gaps, even small, differed from closed-canopy controls in terms of saproxylic species composition. However, only mid-size gaps were distinct from large and especially small gaps. The highest Bray-Curtis dissimilarity occurred between mid-size gaps and closed-canopy controls, and not between large gaps and controls. Partly in agreement with the resource concentration hypothesis, floricolous beetles were more abundant in mid-size and large gaps than in small ones. However, pioneer xylophagous species did not increase and late-successional xylophagous species did not decrease in abundance with increasing gap area. A peak in cumulative and mean local species richness was measured in midsize gaps, but assemblage composition in mid-size gaps was not intermediate between small and large gaps, which does not fully comply with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. From IndVal results, no strictly characteristic species were detected in small gaps, but several ones in mid-sized and large gaps. On the whole, scolytids and pioneer xylophagous beetles were favoured in gaps by an increase in felling density in the 78 and 314 ha surrounding landscapes, respectively. Individual species responses in occurrence or abundance were varied. As the faunistic peculiarity in the gaps was mainly confined to mid- and large-sized gaps, retaining uncleared gaps above 0.5 ha in size is recommended to improve saproxylic gamma diversity in forests.},

The mean volume was 130m3/ha and the variation among reserves was high, ranging from almost nil to 550m3/ha. The volume depended significantly on forest type, age since reserve establishment and volume of living wood. More dead wood was found in montane (rather than lowland/submontane) reserves, longer-established reserves (time since designation) and reserves with higher volumes of living wood. On average, fallen dead wood contributed more to the total dead wood volume than standing dead wood. The percentage of dead wood that was standing was almost twice as high in montane than in lowland/submontane forest reserves (45\% versus 25\%). The volume of dead wood at selected sites changed considerably over time. The fluctuations were significantly higher in lowland/submontane than montane reserves, possibly connected with differences in the disturbance regimes and especially damage caused by windstorms. In NW Europe, the blow down of formerly managed, even-aged stands led to extraordinary high volumes of dead wood shortly after reserve establishment. The implications for forest management and biodiversity conservation are discussed. An increase in dead wood volumes must be carried out in accordance with the local/regional forest type and disturbance regime. Thus, in order to fulfil the requirements of as many wood-depending organisms as possible, it is important to preserve not only larger amounts of dead wood, but also dead wood of different types and dimensions as well as securing a long-term continuity of dead wood.},

Furthermore, we attempted to test if (2) CWD volume and compositional diversity converge for postlogged and postfire stands through stand development, and (3) mixedwoods have more CWD volume and greater compositional diversity than conifer or broadleaf overstory types. We sampled 72 stands ranging in age from 7 to 201 years in fire-origin stands and 7–31 years in managed stands with conifer, mixedwood, and broadleaf overstory types in central boreal Canada. For fire-origin stands, snag volume was 100–260 m3/ha in 7-year-old stands, 5–20 m3/ha in 25-year-old stands, and 25–60 m3/ha in older stands; downed woody debris (DWD) volume decreased from 7 to 72–90 year-old stands, increased in 124- to 139-year-old stands, then either decreased or increased in 201-year-old stands depending on overstory type. CWD diversity increased from 25 to 124–139 year-old and plateaued, but in 7-year-old stands, CWD diversity was as high as that in the 124 and up year-old age classes. Logging resulted in a smaller amount and lower size variability of CWD in 7-year-old stands, with a larger portion being fast-decomposing Betula papyrifera. Most CWD characteristics had not converged by approximately 30 years since disturbance between the two stand origins. More diverse CWD occurred in mixedwoods, but conifer stands contained the greatest CWD volume except in 7 year-old postfire stands.},

We estimate that, globally, these pressures have already slightly reduced average within-sample richness (by 13.6\%), total abundance (10.7\%) and rarefaction-based richness (8.1\%), with changes showing marked spatial variation. Rapid further losses are predicted under a business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample richness is projected to fall by a further 3.4\% globally by 2100, with losses concentrated in biodiverse but economically poor countries. Strong mitigation can deliver much more positive biodiversity changes (up to a 1.9\% average increase) that are less strongly related to countries' socioeconomic status.},

	abstract = {With the intensification of human activities, preserving animal populations is a contemporary challenge of critical importance. In this context, the umbrella species concept is appealing because preserving a single species should result in the protection of multiple co-occurring species. Practitioners, though, face the task of having to find suitable umbrellas to develop single-species management guidelines. In North America, boreal forests must be managed to facilitate the recovery of the threatened boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Yet, the effect of caribou conservation on co-occurring animal species remains poorly documented. We tested if boreal caribou can constitute an effective umbrella for boreal fauna. Birds, small mammals, and insects were sampled along gradients of post-harvest and post-fire forest succession. Predictive models of occupancy were developed from the responses of 95 species to characteristics of forest stands and their surroundings. We then assessed the similarity of species occupancy expected between simulated harvested landscapes and a 90 000-km2 uncut landscape. Managed landscapes were simulated based on three levels of disturbance, two timber-harvest rotation cycles, and dispersed or aggregated cut-blocks. We found that management guidelines that were more likely to maintain caribou populations should also better preserve animal assemblages. Relative to fragmentation or harvest cycle, we detected a stronger effect of habitat loss on species assemblages. Disturbing 22\%, 35\%, and 45\% of the landscape should result, respectively, in 80\%, 60\%, and 40\% probability for caribou populations to be sustainable; in turn, this should result in regional species assemblages with Jaccard similarity indices of 0.86, 0.79, and 0.74, respectively, relative to the uncut landscape. Our study thus demonstrates the value of single-species management for animal conservation. Our quantitative approach allows for the evaluation of management guidelines prior to implementation, thereby providing a tool for establishing suitable compromises between economic and environmental sustainability of human activities.},

The frequency and severity of these episodes is unequivocally expected to increase in the coming decades, through the concerted action of climate change and anthropogenic pressures. This will impose severe challenges for many biota through exposure to rapidly changing conditions never experienced in the preceding millennia. Thus, it is urgently needed to gain a thorough understanding of animal responses and adaptations to disturbances in order to better estimate potential future impacts. Here, we review such adjustments and find that animals may respond to disturbances through changes in: (1) behaviour, such as altered mobility, emigration, resource-switching, refuge use, suspended animation, or biotic interactions; (2) life history traits, such as survival, aging, longevity, recruitment, reproductive restraint, breeding output, phenology and bet-hedging tactics; (3) morphology, such as rapid evolution through size-dependent mortality or facultative metamorphosis; (4) physiology, such as altered body condition, pathogen prevalence and transmission, or adrenocortical modulation of stress responses to emergency conditions; (5) genetic structure, such as changes in frequency of polymorphic variants or diversity-modulation through mortality bottlenecks. Individual-level responses scale up to population and community responses, such as altered density, population dynamics, distribution, local extinction and colonization, or assemblage structure and diversity. Overall, disturbances have pervasive effects on individuals, populations and communities of vertebrates and invertebrates of all realms, biomes, continents and ecosystems. Their rapidly increasing incidence and severity will bring unique study opportunities for researchers and novel, unpredictable challenges for managers, while demanding tougher choices and more proactive crisis-preparation for conservationists, as well as mentality changes for all. Under all conditions, disturbances may soon become the defining signatures of most ecosystems and the dynamic leitmotif of modern ecology.},

It is therefore often suggested that the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances (eg logging) on a managed landscape are attenuated if the patterns and processes created by these events resemble those of natural disturbances (eg fire). To provide forest management guidelines, we investigate the long-term variability in the mean fire interval (MFI) of a boreal landscape in eastern North America, as reconstructed from lacustrine (lake-associated) sedimentary charcoal. We translate the natural variability in MFI into a range of landscape age structures, using a simple modeling approach. Although using the array of possible forest age structures provides managers with some flexibility, an assessment of the current state of the landscape suggests that logging has already caused a shift in the age-class distribution toward a stronger representation of young stands with a concurrent decrease in old-growth stands. Logging is indeed quickly forcing the studied landscape outside of its long-term natural range of variability, implying that substantial changes in management practices are required, if we collectively decide to maintain these fundamental attributes of the boreal forest.},

	abstract = {Old-growth forests are optimal habitats for many woodpeckers, which are often themselves excellent indicators of deadwood-associated biodiversity. Old-growth forests are, however, heterogeneous ecosystems in terms of structure, composition, and deadwood characteristics, thus implying a varied use of these forests by woodpeckers. In boreal landscapes, old-growth stands are threatened by forest harvesting; however, there is little information in regard to the consequences for biodiversity with the loss of specific types of old-growth forests. This study aimed to assess how the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), a biodiversity indicator species associated with old-growth forest attributes, uses different types of old-growth forests for its foraging needs. We identified woodpecker foraging marks in 24 boreal old-growth forest stands in eastern Canada that were dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana), located within the home range of eight black-backed woodpeckers. We identified the various old-growth forest types using a typology based on the structural attributes of old-growth stands. We classified the sampled stands into four old-growth forest types, corresponding to different successional stages (recent or old, relative to the onset of the old-growth stage), composition (pure black spruce or mixed black spruce–balsam fir [Abies balsamea]), and productivity (ongoing paludification or not). The black-backed woodpecker foraged in all types of old-growth forests, but favored dense old-growth forests that were not paludified and that showed a high temporal continuity (i.e., old-growth dynamics probably started more than a century ago). The temporal continuity of the old-growth state allows for the continuous supply of large, slightly decayed snags, the preferred foraging substrates of the black-backed woodpecker. The old-growth forest type most favored by this woodpecker is, however, also the forest type most often targeted first by logging operations. Protecting the biodiversity associated with recent deadwood in managed areas thus requires maintaining a sufficient area and density of dense, old-growth black spruce-dominated forests in managed areas.},

The term Ecological Continuity (EC) has been used to ascribe value to old forest stands. The relative importance of microhabitat and time for colonisation are usually not kept apart when EC is used as a conservation criterium. EC is broadly applied but poorly defined. Use of EC may lead to underestimation of the importance of forest dynamics and dispersal, and to overestimation of the importance of local land use history. If bioindicators of long-term habitat persistence are to be used, species with low dispersal capacity should be chosen. However, many lichens and other fungi, bryophytes and insects cited as indicators of EC, seem to have a patch-tracking lifestyle. They are 'colonists' according to life history strategy classification, and rather seem to indicate specific microhabitats. Terrestrial molluscs, some vascular forest plants, and those bryophytes and lichenized fungi classified as 'perennial stayers' in life history strategy classification, might be used to indicate long-term habitat persistence in forests, but more research is needed to evaluate such indicators.},

	abstract = {Many studies project future bird ranges by relying on correlative species distribution models. Such models do not usually represent important processes explicitly related to climate change and harvesting, which limits their potential for predicting and understanding the future of boreal bird assemblages at the landscape scale. In this study, we attempted to assess the cumulative and specific impacts of both harvesting and climate-induced changes on wildfires and stand-level processes (e.g., reproduction, growth) in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. The projected changes in these landscape- and stand-scale processes (referred to as “drivers of change”) were then assessed for their impacts on future habitats and potential productivity of black-backed woodpecker (BBWO; Picoides arcticus), a focal species representative of deadwood and old-growth biodiversity in eastern Canada. Forest attributes were simulated using a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, and were used to infer future landscape suitability to BBWO under three anthropogenic climate forcing scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), compared to the historical baseline. We found climate change is likely to be detrimental for BBWO, with up to 92\% decline in potential productivity under the worst-case climate forcing scenario (RCP 8.5). However, large declines were also projected under baseline climate, underlining the importance of harvest in determining future BBWO productivity. Present-day harvesting practices were the single most important cause of declining areas of old-growth coniferous forest, and hence appeared as the single most important driver of future BBWO productivity, regardless of the climate scenario. Climate-induced increases in fire activity would further promote young, deciduous stands at the expense of old-growth coniferous stands. This suggests that the biodiversity associated with deadwood and old-growth boreal forests may be greatly altered by the cumulative impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances under a changing climate. Management adaptations, including reduced harvesting levels and strategies to promote coniferous species content, may help mitigate these cumulative impacts.},

How these changes will accumulate and interact with anthropogenic disturbances remains an open question for most species. Location Northeastern Alberta, Canada. Methods We used the LANDIS-II forest landscape model to project changes in forest landscapes, and associated bird populations (72 passerine species), according to three climatic scenarios (baseline, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and three forest harvesting scenarios of differing intensity. Results Both forest harvesting and climate-related drivers were projected to have large impacts on bird communities in this region. As a result of climate-induced increases in fire activity as well as decreased conifer productivity, our simulations projected that an important proportion of Alberta's boreal forests would transition to treeless habitat (i.e. grass- or shrub-dominated vegetation) while many conifer-dominated stands would likely be replaced by broadleaf tree cover. Consequently, the abundance of bird species associated with open and deciduous habitats were projected to increase. With a strong anthropogenic climate-forcing scenario (RCP 8.5), sharp declines in abundance of coniferous trees were also projected, particularly in mature and old forest stands, triggering major declines for bird species associated with coniferous and mixedwood forest types. Main conclusions As the most comprehensive simulation of climate change and harvesting impacts on avian habitats in the North American boreal region to date, our study stresses the importance of considering key habitat characteristics like forest age structure and composition through forest landscape modelling and identifies 18 bird species particularly sensitive to climate change. Our simulations suggest that a change in forest management practices could play an important role in the conservation of boreal bird species vulnerable to climate change. The intensive forest harvesting simulated accelerated declines in bird abundance compared to a “no harvesting” scenario.},

In this scheme, intensity is not directly related to management emphasis.  In this study, research needs were assessed for timber productivity in four forest type groups in the Eastern USA: loblolly-slash pine, white red jack pine, northern hardwoods, and oak hickory in the North (details are given in Supplementary materials on SSFO website).  Based on this preliminary assessment, general areas of research needs seem remarkably similar across all four types discussed. Further, it is likely that similar issues and needs occur in many parts of the world on small scale forest ownerships.  Naturally their specific nature and importance will vary widely.

The practical conclusion is that in southern Finland an extensive restoration program of managed forests to natural-like successional forests is needed to avert the imminent wave of extinctions of specialist forest species.

Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases. We face the challenge of managing trade-offs between immediate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term.},

	abstract = {Designing a reserve system for a threatened territorial species such as the Northern Spotted Owl requires the balancing of biological necessity against economic reality. The Spotted Owl conservation plan and the Pacific Northwest timber industry are in conflict because both demand large areas of mature and old-growth coniferous forests. The primary focus of this paper is the efficient design of a reserve system for territorial species with obligate juvenile dispersal. We examine the relationship between the degree of aggregation of suitable owl habitat, the level of occupancy of that habitat by pairs of Spotted Owls, and the likelihood of owl persistence given different amounts and spatial arrangements of suitable habitat across the landscape. We develop a population model for Spotted Owls that includes an abstracted forest landscape where suitable owl habitat is arrayed in clusters embedded in a matrix not suitable for owl habitation. We conclude from our study of this model that, for any given fraction of the landscape set aside in reserves, the level of occupancy (efficiency of use) of that area will increase as the aggregation of suitable habitat increases. After the reserves reach a size that includes territories for 20 to 25 owl pairs, however, there are diminishing returns from further increases. Preserving connectivity and increasing the geographical extent of the reserve begin to outweigh increased size in importance in insuring the long-term viability of the species.},

It has been argued that in natural populations the impact of inbreeding depression on population survival will be insignificant in comparison to that of demographic and environmental stochasticity12,13. We have now studied the effect of inbreeding on local extinction in a large metapopulation14 of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia)15. We found that extinction risk increased significantly with decreasing heterozygosity, an indication of inbreeding6, even after accounting for the effects of the relevant ecological factors. Larval survival, adult longevity and egg-hatching rate were found to be adversely affected by inbreeding and appear to be the fitness components underlying the relationship between inbreeding and extinction. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an effect of inbreeding on the extinction of natural populations. Our results are particularly relevant to the increasing number of species with small local populations due to habitat loss and fragmentation16.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The global loss of biodiversity and the increasing number of threatened or endangered species have focused attention on conservation and species-recovery strategies. Because current evidence indicates that some amphibians are experiencing population declines, range constrictions, or extinctions, and federal and state agencies have listed many species as threatened or endangered, it is essential to develop sound principles upon which to base recovery plans for different ecosystems, amphibian communities, or species if we are to balance the conservation of amphibian diversity with economic development and a growing human population. I present a framework of biologically based principles that can be used for current species conservation efforts. My goal is to provide the critical elements needed to develop biologically based recovery plans for aquatic-breeding amphibians in any region. This paper is organized in three parts: (1) an overview of critical local population and landscape processes required to maintain amphibian species and threats, (2) the critical elements associated with successful recovery plans, and (3) considerations for measuring success and long-term habitat management. Clearly, we need more basic data on life-history requirements, special adaptations, habitat use, dispersal behavior, and population biology, especially factors influencing long-term persistence for many species. Nevertheless, because some species are in urgent need of conservation action, we cannot afford to wait for additional data; the most important critical elements required to initiate effective recovery efforts for amphibians are known. I hope my discussion will help managers understand the importance of incorporating local population and metapopulation factors into their recovery and restoration plans. I also hope managers begin to think about ultimate recovery and restoration strategies that consider connectivity among populations across regions and state boundaries. Only through such coordinated efforts can we really be certain that species are conserved and biodiversity is maintained.},

In this context, forest biomass, particularly harvesting residues (branches), and stumps and associated coarse roots, can be used to supply fuelwood chains. However, collecting harvesting residues can affect soil properties and trees, and these effects are still not fully understood. The main objective of the present study was to compile published data worldwide and to quantify the overall effects of removing harvesting residues on nutrient outputs, chemical and biological soil fertility and tree growth, through a meta-analysis. Our study showed that, compared with conventional stem-only harvest, removing the stem plus the harvesting residues generally increases nutrient outputs thereby leading to reduced amounts of total and available nutrients in soils and soil acidification, particularly when foliage is harvested along with the branches. Losses of available nutrients in soils could also be explained by reduced microbial activity and mineralization fluxes, which in turn, may be affected by changes in organic matter quality and environmental conditions (soil compaction, temperature and moisture). Soil fertility losses were shown to have consequences for the subsequent forest ecosystem: tree growth was reduced by 3–7\% in the short or medium term (up to 33years after harvest) in the most intensive harvests (e.g. when branches are exported with foliage). Combining all the results showed that, overall, whole-tree harvesting has negative impacts on soil properties and trees that may have an impact on the functioning of forest ecosystems. Practical measures that could be taken to mitigate the environmental consequences of removing harvesting residues are discussed.},

We monitored salamander artificial cover object (ACO) arrays within each site from spring 2012 to fall 2015 and marked all salamanders with visible implant elastomers, generating capture histories for all individuals. Using Program MARK and Pollock's robust design we developed 10 a priori candidate models to test salamander population parameters, with variations on capture probability, recapture probability, survival, emigration, and immigration, as well as a set of models comparing preharvest and postharvest data. To incorporate precipitation events, we classified sessions as wet or dry based on total rainfall prior to sampling. The best performing models were those that incorporated the year, season, and amount of precipitation when estimating capture probabilities. Linear regression results showed percentage of canopy cover and Downed Coarse Woody Derbies (DCWD) were significant predictors of salamander abundance. We also found no significant relationships between survival, DCWD, and canopy cover. Our results suggest DCWD has some impact on variations in population sizes of red-backed salamanders, although other factors are likely contributing as well.},

	abstract = {Many patterns observed in ecology, such as species richness, life history variation, habitat use, and distribution, have physiological underpinnings. For many ectothermic organisms, temperature relationships shape these patterns, but for terrestrial amphibians, water balance may supersede temperature as the most critical physiologically limiting factor. Many amphibian species have little resistance to water loss, which restricts them to moist microhabitats, and may significantly affect foraging, dispersal, and courtship. Using plaster models as surrogates for terrestrial plethodontid salamanders (Plethodon albagula), we measured water loss under ecologically relevant field conditions to estimate the duration of surface activity time across the landscape. Surface activity time was significantly affected by topography, solar exposure, canopy cover, maximum air temperature, and time since rain. Spatially, surface activity times were highest in ravine habitats and lowest on ridges. Surface activity time was a significant predictor of salamander abundance, as well as a predictor of successful recruitment; the probability of a juvenile salamander occupying an area with high surface activity time was two times greater than an area with limited predicted surface activity. Our results suggest that survival, recruitment, or both are demographic processes that are affected by water loss and the ability of salamanders to be surface-active. Results from our study extend our understanding of plethodontid salamander ecology, emphasize the limitations imposed by their unique physiology, and highlight the importance of water loss to spatial population dynamics. These findings are timely for understanding the effects that fluctuating temperature and moisture conditions predicted for future climates will have on plethodontid salamanders.},

This paper compares the assemblages of carabid beetles in such forests with those on unplanted grassland and moorland habitats nearby. Afforestation disrupted the characteristic ground beetle communities of these open upland habitats, and carabid species-richness was low in closed-canopy plantations. However, when all stages of the forestry cycle were considered, the forests as a whole were as species rich as the surrounding habitats. Unplanted areas within the forests contributed to this diversity, but the early successional stages after clear felling were also species rich. The clear fell sites were not favourable habitats for the rarer species of open moorland and grassland and these species also showed decreases in the open habitats within the forests when compared with the open habitats outside. It is concluded that although forests contain as many carabid species as the surrounding open habitats, many of these species only occur on the clear felled areas. There is also a reduction in the numbers of rare species, especially those characteristic of wetter habitats. Wet areas such as mires within the forest should be monitored and managed to prevent further drying out and fragmentation.},

However, no study has tested the hypothesis that the species within the major functional groups also differ in terms of trophic positions. This hypothesis was tested for the first time using stable isotope analysis. We compiled original and published data on the stable isotope composition of 82 collembolan species in temperate forest ecosystems. The δ13C and δ15N values of collembolans were found related to their life forms, reflecting a shift in available food objects across different habitat layers and matching the vertical isotopic gradient of soil organic matter. The trophic niche of species varied among different collembolan orders and families, indicating a pronounced phylogenetic signal and supporting the trophic niche conservatism hypothesis. Considering stable isotope compositions, as well as the taxonomic identity and life form of species, we outlined four collembolan functional guilds that use different types of food and perform different ecosystem functions.},

Here we propose and discuss potential direct and indirect mechanisms of how microarthropods could influence this process with the focus on collembolans, which are in general a relatively well studied taxon. Indirect mechanisms are likely to have larger impacts on soil aggregation than direct effects. The variety of indirect mechanisms based on the provision of organic material like fecal pellets, molts and necromass as food source for microorganisms is high and given available evidence we propose that these mechanisms are the most influential. We highlight the need for overcoming the challenges of culturing and handling of these animals in order to be able to design small scale experiments and field studies which would enable us to understand the role of the different functional groups, their interaction with other soil fauna and the impact of land use practices on soil aggregation.},

Mineral soils in pairs of relatively undisturbed and disturbed pine forests in each of three land resource regions of North Carolina (i.e., coastal plain, piedmont, and mountains) were monitored 15 times over two years. Abundance of nematodes in 35 families, collembolans in 8 families, and 16 other microarthropod taxa were enumerated. Nematodes were identified only in mineral soil whereas microarthropods were identified separately in litter and mineral soil. Rate (mg lost per day) of cellulose and wood decomposition were estimated based on weight loss of standardized substrates enclosed in litter baskets; available nitrate (NO3−) and ammonium (NH4+) were quantified in soil. Principal components analysis was performed on 59 invertebrate taxa to identify the taxa explaining the greatest proportion of variation in the monitored community. Soil microclimate and chemical properties were included as covariables. Canonical correlation was performed to quantify the relationship between soil invertebrate communities and indicators of ecological processes. Variation in soil N availability and decomposition rate was best explained when the two microfaunal communities, nematodes and arthropods, respectively, were examined separately. Nematode communities explained 2.3–6.9\% of the variation in NO3− and NH4+ availability, indicators of N mineralization, in disturbed forests compared to 8.6–12.4\% in undisturbed forests. In contrast, arthropod communities explained 11–14.8\% of the variation in decomposition rate in disturbed forests compared to 2.8–14.3\% in undisturbed forests.

Guilds are often comprised of members of the same family or genus, but they can span larger taxonomic categories. Predacious arthropods, such as carabid beetles, centipedes and spiders, and small carnivorous vertebrates, such as woodland salamanders, overlap extensively in microhabitat and prey types. These taxa, though unrelated, may form important guilds of forest floor predators. We examined the behavioral interactions between a carabid ground beetle (Platynus tenuicollis) and a small woodland salamander (the red-backed salamander, Plethodon cinereus) in laboratory encounters. These species occur syntopically and feed on similar prey. Individuals of P. cinereus are territorial and defend cover objects against conspecific and congeneric intruders. Because both species require moist conditions, it seems probable that they would compete for resources, such as cover objects and prey, as the forest floor and leaf litter dries. We posed two general hypotheses: (1) salamanders will display territorial behavior toward intruding salamanders and beetles and (2) beetles will display territorial behavior toward intruding beetles and salamanders. Residents of each species were paired with control, intra- and interspecific intruders. In both species, residency status affected behavior—residents behaving more aggressively than intruders. Resident salamanders behaved similarly toward intruding salamanders and beetles, but no biting was observed. There were no significant differences in aggressive behavior of resident beetles among treatments. When physical attacks by beetles were observed, they were brief and often escalated to biting and chasing. Platynus tenuicollis bit intruders of both species in a significant number of trials; this often resulted in the production of adhesive secretions by P. cinereus that successfully immobilized P. tenuicollis. Antipredator behaviors observed in P. cinereus, and biting by P. tenuicollis of P. cinereus, suggest that intraguild predation may be as important as interspecific resource competition for these species of forest floor predators.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial salamanders have been hypothesized to play an important role in the regulation of invertebrate communities on the forest ﬂoor. Previous studies testing this hypothesis have used ﬁeld enclosure or laboratory microcosm methods that may bias outcomes, and no studies have addressed the extent to which environmental heterogeneity affects the strength of salamander effects. In the present study, the effects of the red-backed salamander, Plethodon cinereus, on forest-ﬂoor invertebrates were examined in open ﬁeld plots in which neither the movements of salamanders nor invertebrates were impeded. This 2-year study assessed the inﬂuence of the bottom-up effect of leaf-litter mass by comparing salamander effects in the spring when litter was abundant to autumn, just prior to leaf fall, when litter thickness was low. Plethodon cinereus was found to exert top-down effects on several mesofaunal taxa, but no effects on macrofauna were detected. Salamander effects varied among sampling periods. Leaf-litter mass and, to a lesser extent, litter moisture were the determinants of invertebrate density in spring and fall 2003, whereas salamanders were the single signiﬁcant factor inﬂuencing mesofaunal density in spring 2004, when both leaf-litter mass and litter moisture were especially high. Leaf-litter mass and salamanders in combination inﬂuenced mesofaunal densities in fall 2004. The results suggest that the top-down effects of salamanders are strongest in spring when hydric conditions and availability of moisture-retaining cover enhance salamander foraging success, and when salamanders affect initial, rapid stages of mesofaunal population growth.},

Field removal experiments showed that interspecfic competition was much stronger in the Great Smoky Mountains than in the Balsam Mountains, and transplant experiments between the two mountain ranges showed that neither species from the Balsam Mountains had a measurable effect on its congener in the Smokies, although both species from the Smokies had strong negative effects on the Balsam congeners. Other experiments were conducted on the behavioral and ecological changes that have (or have not) evolved in the two areas.

After four weeks we sampled arthropod abundance with pitfall traps. The abundance of arthropods was compared using two-way MANOVA (treatments = salamanders and season), followed by univariate tests for each taxon. The effects of salamanders on arthropods was not significant (Wilks' lambda = 0.76, P = 0.6), but Collembola were significantly more abundant in the presence of salamanders. Season had a significant effect on arthropod abundance (Wilks' lambda = 0.13, P {\textless} 0.0001); beetles, crickets, millipedes, and mites were more abundant in the fall, and Collembola were more abundant in the spring. Stomach analysis of salamanders showed that ants were their main prey item, and Collembola were not among the prey taken.

A promising approach is to link the red-list status of species and specific traits that connect species of functionally important taxa or guilds to resources they rely on. Such traits can be used to detect the influence of anthropogenic ecosystem changes and conservation efforts on species, which allows for practical recommendations for conservation. We modeled the German Red List categories as an ordinal index of extinction risk of 1025 saproxylic beetles with a proportional-odds linear mixed-effects model for ordered categorical responses. In this model, we estimated fixed effects for intrinsic traits characterizing species biology, required resources, and distribution with phylogenetically correlated random intercepts. The model also allowed predictions of extinction risk for species with no red-list category. Our model revealed a higher extinction risk for lowland and large species as well as for species that rely on wood of large diameter, broad-leaved trees, or open canopy. These results mirror well the ecological degradation of European forests over the last centuries caused by modern forestry, that is the conversion of natural broad-leaved forests to dense conifer-dominated forests and the loss of old growth and dead wood. Therefore, conservation activities aimed at saproxylic beetles in all types of forests in Central and Western Europe should focus on lowlands, and habitat management of forest stands should aim at increasing the amount of dead wood of large diameter, dead wood of broad-leaved trees, and dead wood in sunny areas.},

	abstract = {The extinction of species is a non-random process, and understanding why some species are more likely to go extinct than others is critical for conservation efforts. Functional trait-based approaches offer a promising tool to achieve this goal. In forests, deadwood-dependent (saproxylic) beetles comprise a major part of threatened species, but analyses of their extinction risk have been hindered by the availability of suitable morphological traits. To better understand the mechanisms underlying extinction in insects, we investigated the relationships between morphological features and the extinction risk of saproxylic beetles. Specifically, we hypothesised that species darker in colour, with a larger and rounder body, a lower mobility, lower sensory perception and more robust mandibles are at higher risk. We first developed a protocol for morphological trait measurements and present a database of 37 traits for 1,157 European saproxylic beetle species. Based on 13 selected, independent traits characterising aspects of colour, body shape, locomotion, sensory perception and foraging, we used a proportional-odds multiple linear mixed-effects model to model the German Red List categories of 744 species as an ordinal index of extinction risk. Six out of 13 traits correlated significantly with extinction risk. Larger species as well as species with a broad and round body had a higher extinction risk than small, slim and flattened species. Species with short wings had a higher extinction risk than those with long wings. On the contrary, extinction risk increased with decreasing wing load and with higher mandibular aspect ratio (shorter and more robust mandibles). Our study provides new insights into how morphological traits, beyond the widely used body size, determine the extinction risk of saproxylic beetles. Moreover, our approach shows that the morphological characteristics of beetles can be comprehensively represented by a selection of 13 traits. We recommend them as a starting point for functional analyses in the rapidly growing field of ecological and conservation studies of deadwood.},

Although ecological and behavioral interactions among species of salamanders have been well studied, little is known about the interactions between territorial P. cinereus and other ecologically similar species, such as large predatory invertebrates. Our field data indicate that P. cinereus and a large syntopic centipede, Scolopocryptops sexspinosus, exhibit negative spatial associations in natural habitats, possibly indicating interspecific territoriality. Only seven instances of salamander/centipede co-occurrence were recorded from a field sample of 247 occupied cover objects. Cover object size was positively correlated with salamander SVL (tip of the snout to the anterior end of the cloaca), but there was no correlation of cover object size to centipede length. Data on the ability of P. cinereus to differentiate among chemicals on the substrate suggest that visual cues are not necessary to elicit a territorial response from intruding salamanders. Although in laboratory trials salamanders behaved similarly toward intruders of both species, biting was directed only toward centipedes. Salamanders spent significantly more time approaching centipedes than they did approaching other salamanders. Approach behavior was often associated with nose tapping and may be an investigative, rather than aggressive, behavior. We suggest that territorial P. cinereus respond similarly to intruding salamanders and centipedes, but that they escalate more readily to biting centipedes because S. sexspinosus is sightless and thus unable to respond to visual signals.},

	abstract = {(1) Optimal foraging theory predicts that predators will rank all potential types of prey by their profitability and then specialize on the most profitable type when it is abundant. We designed an experiment to test whether the red-backed salamander, Plethodon cinereus (Green), determines the caloric profitability of prey by innate recognition, by relative sizes of the prey or by learning through previous experience with the prey types. (2) Salamanders were trained for 3 months under four conditions: biweekly feedings of (I) both large and small flies, (II) large flies only, (III) small flies only or (IV) a non-dipteran prey. Each group was then given a high density of both large and small flies and choice of diet was determined. (3) Only after Condition I did the salamanders appear to forage `optimally': expressing a high degree of specialization on large flies, rejecting more encountered small than large flies, pursuing more large than small flies, having shorter intercapture intervals and higher positive rates of net energy. (4) The salamanders did not rely on an inherited ability to assess profitability, because they could specialize on the more profitable prey even though it is not in their natural diet. They did not use relative sizes of prey to judge profitability, because they failed to specialize after Conditions III and IV. (5) We conclude that they learned through foraging experience to assess profitabilities of the prey types. Such experience is necessary to balance off the gross caloric value of the prey types (which can be estimated by size) against the rate at which those prey types can be assimilated once ingested (which is a variable depending on chitinous content of the arthropods).},

We examined the behavior of two species of ground beetle (Scaphinotus angusticollis and Pterostichus melanarius) towards juvenile western red-backed salamanders (Plethodon vehiculum) in staged laboratory encounters. We predicted that the beetles would show more aggression towards small (snout–vent length (SVL) ≤30 mm) than large (30 {\textless} SVL ≤ 40 mm) juvenile salamanders, as small individuals frequently had missing tails (indicating predation) in the field. Our additional objective was to examine antipredator behavior of P. vehiculum. Scaphinotus angusticollis approached, bit, and climbed on the salamanders more frequently than P. melanarius did, but neither beetle behaved differently towards small and large salamanders. Small juveniles jerked away more frequently than larger individuals when bitten by P. melanarius and when climbed on by S. angusticollis, but otherwise the behavior of salamanders of the two size classes did not differ. After overnight encounters, the injuries on the salamanders included missing toes and tail tips and skin lacerations. Scaphinotus angusticollis consumed an additional six P. vehiculum, and P. melanarius consumed three. The damage was unrelated to the size (SVL) of the salamanders, but all individuals consumed were among the smallest we tested. We suggest that in terms of both its morphology and its behavior, S. angusticollis is better suited than P. melanarius to prey on P. vehiculum, and probably preys on hatchlings in the wild.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneity in species assemblages of forest-floor arthropods m carabid beetles, ants and spiders m within and between different forest age classes was studied in the southern Finnish taiga. The importance of processes operating on the local scale (within the movement radius of the species) vs on the regional scale (among forest stands) in determining the observed variation was assessed. Four data sets with different spatial resolutions in mesic forests in the same general study area were used. The material consists of 18 283 carabids of 51 species, 48 769 spiders of 212 species, and 126 718 worker ants of 23 species. Analyses of abundance variation and species complementarity among successional stages revealed that in all the three taxa species occurring in the mature forest were prevalent in the younger successional stages as well, constituting more than half of the catch in any age class. A great majority of carabid and spider species were widely distributed across the forest age classes, whereas ants include a higher proportion of species with a narrower amplitude across the succession gradient. Comparisons of similarity between samples at increasing distance from one another on the local scale within forest stands (a few tens of meters to a few hundreds of meters) showed a quite consistent pattern in carabids and spiders: there was more variation between sampling sites in young successional forests than in the mature forest. Furthermore, only in the mature forest a slight, albeit statistically not significant, negative relationship between similarity of samples and distance between sampling sites was detected. In carabids and spiders, comparisons between samples located at a distance of 10n15 m from each other showed considerable heterogeneity, the mean percentage similarity being c. 0.6 (in ants c. 0.8). On the regional scale, systematic variation between young and mature forest stands is a major element increasing the total diversity (species turnover c. 50\% in carabids and spiders; compositional similarity c. 0.3n0.4 in carabids, 0.2n0.3 in spiders), but variation within forest stands on a spatial scale of 10n15 meters is another important component in the total heterogeneity. The results suggest that regional abundance variation is a primary factor influencing the composition of local assemblages; a set of hypotheses elaborating this conclusion is formulated. The result implies that maintenance of habitat heterogeneity on a small scale (10n15 m) is needed to preserve biodiversity in managed forests.},

In a comprehensive study on 464 carabid beetle species, we used ordinal logistic regression to analyze the relationship of species traits to extinction risk in Central Europe, taking phylogenetic relatedness into account. To consider varying trait responses in different habitat types, we also tested models for species groups associated with different habitat types (forest, open, riparian and wetland). Our results identified three traits of particular importance as predictors for high extinction risk: (1) high habitat specialization, (2) small distribution range size (which is not considered in the categorization of the German Red List), and (3) large body size. Furthermore, large macropterous species showed high extinction risk. Overall, species associated with mountainous, coastal and open habitats generally revealed a high risk of extinction, while most forest species showed a low extinction risk. However, forest species with predatory feeding behavior were threatened, as were wetland species that reproduce in autumn. Phylogenetic relatedness had no influence on how species traits predict carabid beetle extinction risk. In the light of these results, management and recovery plans for species which exhibit characteristic traits strongly associated with extinction risks, as well as the conservation and restoration of mountain, coastal and open habitats, have to be prioritized.},

In montane lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas var. latifolia Engelm.) forest, Calathus advena Lec., Carabus chamissonis Fish., Leistus ferruginosus Mnh., Nebria intermedia V. D., Platynus decentis Say, Pterostichus brevicornis Kby., Pterostichus riparius Dej., Scaphinotus marginatus Fisch. and Trechus chalybeus Dej. are common in post-rotation age forest with no history of harvesting, but scarce in or absent from regenerating sites, even 27 years after harvest. Residual populations of old-growth specialists in uncut fragments are exposed to increased contact with habitat generalists and open-habitat specialists from surrounding cut-overs and regenerating forests. Populations of several species of old-growth specialists in lodgepole pine live also in younger, fire-origin stands in boreal aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux.) stands of the "mixedwood" zone. We hypothesize that they have recolonized from the large surrounding tracts of unburned residual forest remaining after fire. Thus, landscape-scale effects, resulting in changes in regional population size, may alter the probability of species retention in old-growth fragments, and of the recolonization of cut-blocks by particular species characteristic of old-growth.},

Maintaining compositional and structural features that provide adequate habitat for species within managed stands is the basis of coarse-filter conservation strategies. Here we test the effect of stand composition and stand structure on the epigaeic arthropod fauna from four boreal mixedwood cover types in western Canada. We observed differences in epigaeic community composition and species-specific associations among each of the four cover types. Differences in the carabid fauna between cover types were defined by relative abundance of carabid species associated specifically with moss cover, forb cover, and of coarse woody material, rather than unique, stand-specific species compositions of the overstory. Cover-type differences were less apparent among the comparatively species-rich spider assemblages largely because of their low abundance in undisturbed stands. For the effective conservation of all species, our results suggest that coarse-filter management of mixedwood boreal forests must incorporate structural features beyond overstory canopy composition. Our analyses also suggest that activities directed at managing the amount of coarse woody material on the ground and understory plant composition, perhaps through variable retention harvesting, is a logical first step.},

Pitfall trap catches of carabids from leaf-litter plots were compared with those from control plots to explore the effect of leaf-litter addition. Difference in the species composition was revealed by ordination; scores of the samples of the two plot types were significantly separated along the first MDS axis. The most numerous species (Pterostichus oblongopunctatus) was significantly more abundant in the leaf-litter plots. However, there were no significant differences for the other most frequently obtained species. Habitat generalist species were the most abundant, followed by forest generalists, then forest specialists, and there were some open habitat species. Enhanced habitat heterogeneity (leaf-litter addition) in homogeneous plantations influenced the spatial distribution and composition of carabids, through altered abiotic (lower ground temperature in the leaf-litter plots) and biotic (more prey items) factors. Differences in abundance, species richness and Shannon diversity were not significant between the control and the manipulated plots, although carabid catch was higher in the leaf-litter plots during both years. Forestry practices to increase habitat heterogeneity should be considered to enhance biodiversity in managed forests.},

Yet, studies on dead wood diversity frequently focus on conspicuous organisms such as birds or saproxylic beetles, and are rarely deployed across significant climatic gradients. Here, we investigated the potential role of deadwood as a habitat for springtails, an understudied group of invertebrates generally associated with soils, and tested how these communities were influenced by climate. Black spruce logs were placed in 13 natural forest sites which were distributed among 3 latitudinal zones (southern, central and northern Quebec, Canada). We compared the springtail communities that colonized the logs through different metrics: abundance, richness and species composition. Our results indicated that dead wood was used as a habitat by 74 springtail species. A clear latitudinal diversity gradient was observed, with southern communities being on average two times richer and over 13 times more abundant than the northern ones per log. Moreover, distinct community compositions were observed in the three zones. Overall, our results suggest that (1) dead wood retention could be beneficial for small invertebrates such as springtails and (2) such biodiversity conservation measures would be more efficient if done systematically along large geographic gradients encompassing different biomes, particularly in the context of climate change.},

The microbial biomass (total PLFAs) decreased significantly due to the highest rate of wood-ash fertilization, clear-cutting, and the two different fire treatments when compared to control amounts. Fungi appeared more seriously reduced by these treatments than bacteria, as revealed by a decreased index of fungal:bacterial PLFAs when compared to the controls. The community structure was evaluated using the PLFA pattern. The largest treatment effect was due to burning in both areas studied, which resulted in increases in 16:1ω5 and proportional decreases in 18:2ω6. Clear-cutting and the different amounts of ash application resulted in similar changes in the PLFA pattern to the burning treatments, but these were less pronounced. Attempts to correlate the changes in the PLFA pattern to soil pH, bacterial pH response patterns (measured using thymidine incorporation), or substrate quality (measured using IR spectroscopy) were only partly successful. Instead, we hypothesize that the changes in the PLFA pattern of the soil organisms were related to an altered substrate quantity, that is the availability of substrates after the treatments.},

Densities of microarthropod suborders were lower in the strip-cut corridors of the deciduous stands and significantly lower in the suborder Oribatida (oribatid mites). Changes in microarthropod community composition, decreased relative abundance of prostigmatid mites, and increased relative abundance of mesostigmatid mites were observed in corridor and clear-cut treatments. Lowered abundances and changes in community composition are likely due to compaction of the forest floor during harvesting. Selected oribatid mite species showed significantly lower abundances in clearcuts than in uncut sites, but diversity indices for oribatid mites were generally not significantly different between uncut sites and clearcuts. Changes in oribatid mite communities following harvesting were thus more quantitative (absolute abundance) than qualitative (diversity, composition), and as a result, use of oribatid mites as biological indicators of disturbance is limited because of the lack of changes in species composition.},

Soil processes, such as carbon and nutrient cycles, which determine the functioning of these ecosystems, are controlled by soil fauna. Thus assessing the responses of soil fauna communities to environmental change will improve the predictability of the climate change impacts on ecosystem functioning. For this purpose, trait assessment is a promising method compared to the traditional taxonomic approach, but it has not been applied earlier. In this study the response of a sub-arctic soil Collembola community to long-term (16 years) climate manipulation by open top chambers was assessed. The drought-susceptible Collembola community responded strongly to the climate manipulation, which substantially reduced soil moisture and slightly increased soil temperature. The total density of Collembola decreased by 51\% and the average number of species was reduced from 14 to 12. Although community assessment showed species-specific responses, taxonomically based community indices, species diversity and evenness, were not affected. However, morphological and ecological trait assessments were more sensitive in revealing community responses. Drought-tolerant, larger-sized, epiedaphic species survived better under the climate manipulation than their counterparts, the meso-hydrophilic, smaller-sized and euedaphic species. Moreover it also explained the significant responses shown by four taxa. This study shows that trait analysis can both reveal responses in a soil fauna community to climate change and improve the understanding of the mechanisms behind them.},

Pre-treatment samples were collected in 1995 and the stands were logged the following winter. A three-summer follow-up study indicated the following. (1) Carabid assemblages changed with varying speed and intensity after logging. (2) Stands with small openings maintained the original assemblage structure best. Generalists were more abundant in clear-cut stands than in the stands with openings, indicating stronger assemblage-level changes in the large clear-cuts.

However, little is known about the effects of partial harvesting on wildlife populations. Thus, we examined effects of high-leave shelterwood management on terrestrial salamanders prior to and after an initial harvest and a subsequent overstory removal harvest (ORH) 13 years later. On an experimental research site in southwestern Virginia, we compared changes in salamander captures in this plot to a clearcut and control plot 1994–1996 and 2007–2009. Compared to contemporaneous estimates from an unharvested control, salamander captures were lower on shelterwood and clearcut plots 2-years after the initial harvest (1996) and lower on the shelterwood plot 1- and 2-years after the ORH (2008, 2009). Captures of the most common species, Plethodon cinereus (Eastern Red-backed Salamanders), followed similar trends with fewer captures in both harvested plots 2-years after the initial harvest (1996), but only the ORH differed from the control 2-years after the second partial harvest (2009). Abundance of woody debris was greater in the shelterwood following the ORH but was more decayed in the control plot. The regenerating clearcut (14 years post-harvest) had deeper leaf litter and denser understory vegetation than the ORH. These data are some of the first available describing effects of multiple harvest entries on terrestrial salamanders and suggest cumulative negative impacts on salamanders may occur from partial harvesting systems. More long-term monitoring of salamander populations is justified in silvicultural systems with multiple entries within a rotation.},

In particular, declines (quantified as the correlation between year and the respective community response) were more consistent in sites with many non-native trees or a large amount of timber harvested before the onset of sampling. Correlations at the species level depended on species’ life-history. Larger species, more abundant species, and species of higher trophic level declined most, while herbivores increased. This suggests potential shifts in food webs possibly affecting ecosystem functioning.

	abstract = {Harvest of forest biomass, specifically downed woody material (DWM), will increase to meet rising demand for alternative energy sources. Biomass harvest may reduce habitat quality, abundance, and regional diversity of forest-dependent species such as amphibians. We synthesize available literature conducted in landscapes managed for timber production to (1) assess the current state of knowledge regarding DWM management and amphibian population dynamics and (2) identify pertinent research gaps for future biomass studies. In general, the 25 studies we reviewed reported that amphibian counts were positively correlated with DWM levels. Although studies involving terrestrial salamanders often stressed the importance of retaining DWM in harvested systems, empirical support for this conclusion is uncertain due to study- and species-specific variation in responses. Lack of a DWM effect was often attributed to downed wood that was not well decayed or was too small for amphibian use. We identified several critical research needs, including: (1) understanding temporal dynamics of DWM (e.g., recruitment and decay rates) in regenerating forests and its influence on amphibian populations, (2) determining how amphibian use of harvest units relates to configuration and characteristics of DWM, (3) understanding how DWM management influences amphibian demographic rates, and (4) development of sampling and analytical techniques that support separation of sampling error and ecological effects. We suggest that future studies estimate effects of biomass harvest and identify, test, and refine operational harvest strategies that minimize impacts to amphibian populations.

	abstract = {Balancing timber production and conservation in forest management requires an understanding of how timber harvests affect wildlife species. Terrestrial salamanders are useful indicators of mature forest ecosystem health due to their importance to ecosystem processes and sensitivity to environmental change. However, the effects of timber harvests on salamanders, though often researched, are still not well understood. To further this understanding, we used artificial cover objects to monitor the relative abundance of terrestrial salamanders for two seasons (fall and spring) pre-harvest and five seasons post-harvest in six forest management treatments, and for three seasons post-harvest across the edge gradients of six recent clearcuts. In total, we recorded 19,048 encounters representing nine species of salamanders. We observed declines in mean encounters of eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) and northern slimy salamanders (P. glutinosus) from pre- to post-harvest in group selection cuts and in clearcuts. However, we found no evidence of salamander declines at shelterwoods and forested sites adjacent to harvests. Edge effects induced by recent clearcuts influenced salamanders for approximately 20 m into the forest, but edge influence varied by slope orientation. Temperature, soil moisture, and canopy cover were all correlated with salamander counts. Our results suggest silvicultural techniques that remove the forest canopy negatively affect salamander relative abundance on the local scale during the years immediately following harvest, and that the depth of edge influence of clearcuts on terrestrial salamanders is relatively shallow (},

Salamander abundance and species richness were lowest in very young stands and highest in stands more than 120 years old. Comparisons of recent clearcuts less than 5 years old with mature stands more than 80 years old suggest that terrestrial salamanders are completely eliminated or reduced to very low numbers when mature forests are clear cut. Comparisons of stand age categories further suggest that salamander abundance in local communities slowly increases for a century or more after stands are intensively harvested. We roughly estimate that logging during the last century by both the private and public sector has resulted in 1 70\% decline in salamander numbers within the study area as a whole. Implementation of an ecosystem-management strategy which reverses the current trend of having landscapes dominated by early and mid-successional forests would help restore depleted populations to levels where salamanders better fulfill their ecological roles as forest-floor insectivores. Other management techniques that would benefit salamanders include leaving buffers along headwater streams, and using harvesting techniques which assure that the basic structure and function of forests remain intact following timbering operations.},

Salamander abundance on 225 m2 plots located on clearcuts and in nearby forest was determined by nightly non-destructive searches. Abundances on clearcut and forest plots at a given site were compared for each year in which sampling occurred. Numbers of salamanders on clearcut plots decreased to 30–50\% of forested plots in the first year after logging and were almost zero by the second year. Decreases in standing crop and moisture content of leaf litter seem responsible for salamander disappearance. Salamanders returned to clearcuts 4–6 years after cutting, and their numbers increased rapidly. Linear regressions estimate that salamander numbers on clearcut plots will equal or exceed numbers on forested plots by 20–24 years after cutting. The pattern of salamander return to clearcuts appears closely correlated with the timing of litter layer reformation. All sex and age classes of the most common species, Plethodon jordani, disappear from clearcuts at equal rates, whereas the earliest colonizers are predominantly large adults. Plethodon oconaluftee, a desiccation-resistant species, exists on regenerating clearcuts in disproportionately large numbers. Large adults of all species, including Plethodon oconaluftee, may be better able to withstand the drier, sparse litter cover of young, regenerating stands. Adults might move to clearcuts to avoid competition from smaller and immature salamanders restricted to mature forests with abundant, moist litter.},

	abstract = {With an increasing pressure on forested landscapes, conservation areas may fail to maintain biodiversity if they are not supported by the surrounding managed forest matrix. Worldwide, forests are managed by one of two broad approaches—even- and uneven-aged silviculture. In recent decades, there has been rising public pressure against the systematic use of even-aged silviculture (especially clear-cutting) because of its perceived negative esthetic and ecological impacts. This led to an increased interest for uneven-aged silviculture. However, to date, there has been no worldwide ecological comparison of the two approaches, based on multiple indicators. Overall, for the 99 combinations of properties or processes verified (one study may have evaluated more than one property or process), we found nineteen (23) combinations that clearly showed uneven-aged silviculture improved the evaluated metrics compared to even-aged silviculture, eleven (16) combinations that showed the opposite, and 60 combinations that were equivocal. Furthermore, many studies were based on a limited study design without either a timescale (44 of the 76) or spatial (54 of the 76) scale consideration. Current views that uneven-aged silviculture is better suited than even-aged silviculture for maintaining ecological diversity and processes are not substantiated by our analyses. Our review, by studying a large range of indicators and many different taxonomic groups, also clearly demonstrates that no single approach can be relied on and that both approaches are needed to ensure a greater number of positive impacts. Moreover, the review clearly highlights the importance of maintaining protected areas as some taxonomic groups were found to be negatively affected no matter the management approach used. Finally, our review points to a lack of knowledge for determining the use of even- or uneven-aged silviculture in terms of both their respective proportion in the landscape and their spatial agency.},

Key attributes determining the suitability of down wood as habitat are decay stage, tree species, and size, specifically diameter. Both quantity and distribution of suitable down wood influence species’ presence and abundance. We present a simple framework describing use of down wood based on broad natural history features, derive predictions from the framework, then test these by review and summary of literature. Our focus is terrestrial vertebrates, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. Species other than vertebrates are addressed to ensure that metrics derived for vertebrates also are appropriate for other organisms. Basic metrics are the same, but appropriate values span a larger range among nonvertebrates. Current evidence suggests that the “extinction debt” apparent for nonvertebrates is approaching for vertebrates. Predictions derived from underlying natural history hold when tested. From that basis we derive broad guidelines for forest planning and practice, and suggest how regional target values can be derived.},

From May to August in 2008 (pretreatment) and 2011 (post-treatment), we evaluated the response of salamanders to three silvicultural practices designed to promote oak regeneration — prescribed fire, midstory herbicide application and shelterwood harvest — and a control. We trapped salamanders using drift fences with pitfall traps in five replicates of the four treatments. Only the southern gray-cheeked salamander Plethodon metcalfi and the southern Appalachian salamander P. teyahalee were captured in sufficient numbers for robust statistical analysis. We analyzed data for these species using single-species dynamic occupancy models in statistical software program R. We allowed changes in four covariates to influence extinction probability from pre- to post-treatment implementation: 1) percent leaf litter cover; 2) percent understory cover; 3) percent CWD cover; and 4) percent canopy cover. The final combined model set describing extinction probability contained four models with ΔAIC {\textless} 2 for P. metcalfi and nine models with ΔAIC {\textless} 2, including the null model, for P. teyahalee. For both species, the 95\% confidence intervals for model-averaged extinction probability parameter estimates overlapped zero, suggesting none were significant predictors of extinction probability. Absence of short-term salamander response in midstory herbicide and prescribed burn treatments was likely because of minor or transitory changes to forest structure. In shelterwood harvests, any potential effects of reduced canopy and leaf litter cover may have been mitigated by rapid post-treatment vegetation sprouting. Additionally, climatic conditions associated with high elevation sites and high amounts of rainfall in 2011 may have compensated for potential changes to microclimate. Continued monitoring of Plethodon salamanders to assess responses at longer time scales (e.g. {\textgreater} 3 years post-treatment) is warranted.},

	abstract = {Forest amphibians, especially salamanders, prefer forests with shaded, cool, and moist forest floors. Timber harvesting opens the forest canopy and exposes the forest floor to direct sunlight, which can increase forest floor temperatures and reduce soil moisture. These microclimatic changes can potentially degrade the harvested stand for amphibian habitat or affect other biotic resources or ecological processes at the forest floor and in the understory. The degree of forest floor disturbance is directly related to the intensity of harvesting, however, the duration of this effect is unknown. We conducted a study of forest floor temperature and relative humidity over a 12-year chronosequence (1993–2004) of timber harvests. We compared simultaneous, paired measurements of temperature and relative humidity at three positions (soil, forest floor, air) in harvested and control sites over three seasonal survey sessions. Vegetation composition and structure were measured at each survey location. Ambient weather conditions were recorded at three open-field locations across the study area. We recorded over 23,000 paired measures of temperature and relative humidity at all 12 harvested and control sites during each survey session. While we found significant effects of time-since-harvesting on differences in temperature between harvested and uncut sites, the average differences were generally small ({\textless}1°C). We observed no temporal pattern in temperatures with time-since-harvest in the harvested sites compared to uncut conditions. Time-since-harvest had no effect on differences in relative humidity between cut and uncut sites. The variation in forest floor microclimate among sites was large, likely due to small-scale differences in cutting intensity (retained canopy), understory vegetation growth, and microtopography or aspect. We conclude that timber harvesting, within the range of intensities assessed in this study, would have only minimal and short-term effects on forest floor microclimate. We suggest that the small differences we observed in forest floor temperatures and moisture between cut and uncut forest parcels would likely have minor effects on climatic aspects of forest amphibian habitat, and on climatic influences on other forest floor biota and ecological processes.},

Our study consisted of two treatment phases: Phase I treatments included downed CWD removal (removal of all downed CWD), all CWD removal (removal of all downed and standing CWD), pre-treatment snag, and control; Phase II treatments included downed CWD addition (downed CWD volume increased 5-fold), snag addition (standing CWD volume increased 10-fold), all CWD removal (all CWD removed), and control. Amphibian and anuran capture rates were greater in control than all CWD removal plots during study Phase I. In Phase II, reptile diversity and richness were greater in downed CWD addition and all CWD removal than snag addition treatments. Capture rate of Rana sphenocephala was greater in all CWD removal treatment than downed CWD addition treatment. The dominant amphibian and snake species captured are adapted to burrowing in sandy soil or taking refuge under leaf litter. Amphibian and reptile species endemic to upland southeastern Coastal Plain pine forests may not have evolved to rely on CWD because the humid climate and short fire return interval have resulted in historically low volumes of CWD.},

Using large study sites (average size of 400 ha) as the experimental unit, we tested the effects of uneven-aged and even-aged forest management treatments compared with no-harvest management (i.e., control) on the relative abundance of 13 focal amphibian and reptile species. Within even-aged management sites, we also focused on the local-scale effects of clearcutting on these species by comparing relative abundance among plots located within clearcut stands, 50 m away from clearcut stands, and 200 m away from clearcut stands. Pretreatment sampling of species abundance occurred from 1992 through 1995, and post-treatment sampling occurred from 1997 through 2000. At the landscape scale, treatment significantly affected the abundance of Bufo americanus. This species declined less on even-aged management sites than on control sites, but the general decline on all sites suggests that other factors may have contributed to this result. Within even-aged management sites, most amphibian species declined and some reptile species increased relative to pretreatment abundances within clearcut stands. We found significant effects of distance from clearcut for two amphibian species, Ambystoma maculatum and Rana clamitans, and two reptile species, Scincella lateralis and Sceloporus undulatus. In general, we conclude that clearcuts within even-aged management sites locally affected amphibian and reptile species but, at a larger spatial scale, we did not detect significant effects of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management. These findings represent relatively short-term data but suggest that forest management and maintenance of biodiversity may be compatible when relatively small amounts of the landscape are disturbed.},

Comparisons of recently regenerated forests with mature forests{\textgreater} 70 years old indicated that terrestrial salamanders were reduced to very low numbers when mature forests had been intensively harvested. This reduction may result from a decrease in microhabitat availability. Forest age-class comparisons further indicated that salamander abundance slowly increased over time after forests had regenerated. Management decisions that take into account plethodontid salamander abundance and their response to forest structural diversity are important components in sustaining ecosystem integrity while maximizing economic yield.},

Standing snags and large logs on the forest floor affect soil processes, soil fertility, hydrology, and wildlife microhabitat. Few data are available pertaining to the distribution and abundance of CWD in the managed hardwood forests of the central Appalachians. We surveyed 11 stands, at various stages of development (succession) after clear-cutting ({\textless}2, 15–25, 65–90, {\textgreater}100 years old), to evaluate the density, volume, and biomass of trees, snags, and logs under the local forest management regime. As expected, density, volume, and biomass of CWD (stems ≥2.5 cm diameter) were greatest in young stands ({\textless}2 years old) immediately following clear-cutting; the vast majority of CWD existed as relatively labile, small-diameter, low decay state logging slash. Young stands retained a few large logs in advanced decay states but observations suggest that these elements were often disturbed (i.e., crushed) by logging equipment during the harvest process. Crushed logs do not function ecologically in the same capacity as large intact logs. A marked decline in CWD was observed in young pole stands (15–25 years old) as slash decomposed. These stands were characterized by a high density of young hardwood stump sprouts in the overstory while maintaining a moderate amount of CWD in middle size and decay states on the forest floor. More mature hardwood stands (65–90 years old) generally exhibited a decrease in live-stem density and an increase in basal area, accompanied by a slight increase in CWD. Commercial thinning presumably limits the contribution of large CWD to the forest floor. This was most clearly evident in the oldest stands ({\textgreater}100 years old) where large CWD was not widely observed. A striking feature across all stands was the near absence of logs in large size classes ({\textgreater}65 cm diameter) and a paucity of logs in mid to late decay stages. We discuss our data in the context of hardwood forest structure and management in the central Appalachians.},

A number of studies have shown that the temperature sensitivity of litter decomposition can vary depending on litter type and extent of decomposition. However, the underlying causes of this variation are not well understood. According to fundamental principles of enzyme kinetics, the temperature sensitivity of microbial decomposition should be inversely related to litter carbon quality. We tested the accuracy of this hypothesis by adding ground plant shoot and root material to soils incubated under controlled conditions and measuring the temperature sensitivities of decomposition at three time points throughout a 53-d incubation. As the overall quality of the litter organic C declined, litter decomposition became more sensitive to temperature. This was true regardless of whether differences in C quality were due to inherent differences in litter chemistry or due to differences in the extent of decomposition. The same pattern was observed when specific C compounds of varying quality were added to soil, suggesting that substrate C quality has a significant and predictable influence on the temperature sensitivity of microbial decomposition.},

Although these changes act in concert, studies on interactive effects are scarce. Here, we conducted a laboratory microcosm experiment to explore the impacts of temperature (9, 12 and 15°C), changes in soil humidity (moist, dry) and plant diversity (1, 4, 16 species) on soil microbial activity and litter decomposition. We found that changes in litter decomposition did not mirror impacts on microbial measures indicating that the duration of the experiment (22 weeks) may not have been sufficient to determine the full magnitude of global change effects. However and notably, changes in temperature, humidity and plant litter diversity/composition affected in a non-additive way the microbial parameters investigated. For instance, microbial metabolic efficiency increased with plant diversity in the high moisture treatment but remained unaffected in low moisture treatment suggesting that climate changes may mask beneficial effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning. Moreover, litter decomposition was unaffected by plant litter diversity/composition but increased with increasing temperature in the high moisture treatment, and decreased with increasing temperature in the low moisture treatment. We conclude that it is inevitable to perform complex experiments considering multiple global change agents in order to realistically predict future changes in ecosystem functioning. Non-additive interactions highlight the context-dependency of impacts of single global change agents.},

However, its effects on forest dynamics are poorly known. In this study, we document the short-term effects of three irregular shelterwood cutting patterns on the establishment and composition of regeneration as well as on its use by snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus E.). Specifically, we compared uniform, gap, and strip cutting patterns with soil preparation, relative to uncut controls. We counted seedlings, browse, and hare pellets, and measured habitat characteristics after two growing seasons in micro-plots delimited in each of the shelterwood cutting patterns. The mixture of soil and humus resulting from scarification promoted yellow birch establishment. Yellow birch seedlings in gaps were more abundant than in controls, but their abundance was comparable to other irregular shelterwood patterns. All irregular shelterwood patterns promoted competition mainly by pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica L.f.), beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta M.), and mountain maple (Acer spicatum Lam.). Snowshoe hare browse on yellow birch was low for all irregular shelterwood patterns. Moose browse pressure was higher than that from hare. We found no short-term impact of the snowshoe hare on yellow birch seedling establishment and survival. Snowshoe hare pellet counts suggested a preference for gaps. This result could be explained by increased food and protective cover from higher seedling and shrub densities in gaps than in other treatments. In the short-term, up to three years post-treatment, irregular shelterwood cutting helps to promote yellow birch regeneration, a semi-tolerant species, while maintaining habitat for snowshoe hare.},

Birds were sampled at 459 sampling stations distributed among the three landscapes. Local habitat and landscape characteristics of the context surrounding each sampling station (500-m and 1-km radius) were also computed. Bird communities were influenced by landscape-scale changes in forest cover. The higher proportion of early-successional habitats in both human-disturbed landscapes resulted in significantly higher abundance of early-successional bird species and generalists. The mean number of mature forest bird species was significantly lower in the industrial and pre-industrial landscapes than in the natural landscape. Landscape-scale conversion of mature forests from mixed-wood to deciduous cover in human-disturbed landscapes was the main cause of changes in mature forest bird communities. In these landscapes, the abundance of species associated with mixed and coniferous forest cover was lower, whereas species that preferred a deciduous cover were more abundant. Variation in bird community composition determined by the landscape context was as important as local habitat conditions, suggesting that predictions on the regional impact of forest management on songbirds with models solely based on local scale factors could be misleading. Patterns of bird species composition were related to several landscape composition variables (proportions of forest types), but not to configuration variables (e.g., interior habitat, amount of edge). Overall, our results indicated that the large-scale conversion of the southern portion of the boreal forest from a mixed to a deciduous cover may be one of the most important threats to the integrity of bird communities in these forest mosaics. Negative effects of changes in bird communities could be attenuated if current forestry practices are modified toward maintaining forest types (deciduous, mixed-wood, and coniferous) at levels similar to those observed under natural disturbances.},

However, the impacts of these activities on thermoregulatory opportunities for turtles are not well understood. We examined the impacts of forestry and aggregate extraction on thermal characteristics of wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) habitat in the Sudbury District, Ontario, by measuring the differences in absolute temperature, thermal landscape structure, and habitat thermal quality among relatively undisturbed sites (N = 2), harvested forestry sites (N = 2), and aggregate pits (N = 2) in 2015. We also tested the potential use of the thermal landscape concept as a predictor of habitat thermal quality. Undisturbed habitats were of higher thermal quality than impacted sites in terms of temperatures experienced in situ by wild wood turtles in their natural home ranges, and never reached temperatures that would be injurious to turtles (i.e., below CTMIN or above CTMAX). The undisturbed sites were of lower quality in terms of optimal temperatures (i.e., Tset), and were generally cooler and their temperatures less variable than those in impacted habitats. The thermal landscape concept provided a useful predictor of habitat thermal quality when the influence of time of day was factored into the predictive model. Our data are important to the conservation and management of wood turtles because they provide a preliminary quantification of the thermal impacts of natural resource extraction on the habitat of an endangered species, and can guide the development of mitigation and rehabilitation plans by providing measures of, and targets for, thermal habitat quality.},

	abstract = {In order to test whether changes in forest composition observed while sampling portions of the landscape originating from different fires may be explained by stand-level processes, I reconstructed species and stand dynamics for mesic sites in the mixed-boreal forests of Quebec. The stands studied are located in the forest surrounding Lake Duparquet in northwestern Quebec and originated from eight successive fires representing a chronosequence of 230 yr. Tree composition and ecological characteristics were assessed in 313 quadrats distributed systematically within the burned areas; one representative stand per fire, presenting the average species composition for clay soils with a moderate moisture regime, was selected for detailed dendroecological analysis. All living and dead stems ({\textgreater} 1 cm dbh) were mapped and cut down in a 20 × 20 m quadrat. Cross sections collected at the root collar and at every meter were analyzed using standard dendrochronological techniques. The age of the stand before the last fire was estimated using snags and logs located in, or in the vicinity of, each quadrat. A PCA (principal-components analysis) ordination of all quadrats shows a gradual change with time since fire from stands dominated by hardwoods (aspen and paper birch), to mixed stands with an important white spruce component, to coniferous stands dominated by balsam fir and white cedar. Despite variations in the age and composition of the stands before the last fire, they generally follow a common pattern characterized by post-fire hardwood dominance. Age structures show successive waves of aspen, birch, and fir recruitment, corresponding respectively to the post-fire cohort, the gradual dismissal of the first aspen cohort, and spruce budworm outbreaks. Each of these waves corresponds to a decrease in hardwoods and an increase in the conifer component of the stand. Suppressed white spruce individuals, recruited primarily as part of the post-fire cohort, experienced growth releases following the dismissal of the first aspen cohorts. White cedar increased in abundance late in succession and tended to outcompete balsam fir in old coniferous stands severely affected by spruce budworm outbreaks. The observed multi-cohort process contrasts with the simple replacement of hardwoods by conifers as suggested by observations of differential growth rates. The patchy distribution of conifer regeneration together with the poorer ability of conifers to rapidly fill gaps may explain why hardwoods are successfully recruited. This gradual rate of change, occurring over several generations, results in the maintenance of an important hardwood component in most stands even in the absence of fire. After 230 yr, stands are still mainly composed of trees originating from punctuated events such as fire, the gradual dismissal of the first aspen cohort, or spruce budworm outbreaks. This contrasts with old-growth boreal forests dominated by spruces in which a quasi-equilibrium is maintained by small canopy disturbances. The study confirms that changes in forest composition observed while sampling portions of the landscape originating from different fires may be explained by simple processes occurring at the stand level.},

Two to 26 yr after clearcutting, tree species diversity significantly decreased from 2.07 to 1.83, and evenness decreased from 0.80 to 0.71 while species richness was maintained. As the number of years since harvesting increased, the importance value of oaks (Quercus L.), hickories (Carya Nutt.), American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), and black birch (Betula lenta L.) decreased while the importance of yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) increased.

Second-generation forests that had almost equal representation of overstory sugar maple and yellow-poplar prior to harvesting had 43\% yellow-poplar and 13\% sugar maple overstory importance 22–26 yr after harvest. Forty-five percent of the dominant crown class stems and 54\% of the codominant class were yellow-poplar. While sugar maple was also an important (13\%) overstory species overall, it had no dominant and few codominant stems and over 30\% importance as overtopped trees and in the understory. As these stands progress through the stem exclusion stage, richness and measures of diversity may continue declining as yellow-poplar basal area increases. FOR. SCI. 50(1):54–64.},

	abstract = {The impact of traditional even-aged forest management on landscape age structure, tree composition, and connectivity has been well documented. Very little, however, is known about the impact on stand structural diversity. This study aims to compare the structural and abiotic characteristics of forest stands disturbed by clearcut logging and by stand-replacing fire in Quebec’s boreal landscapes. We hypothesized that unlike fire, logging specifically targeted stands having a higher economic value, i.e., merchantable volume, leaving altered forest characteristics on post-harvested landscapes. We compared two aerial forest surveys of a 2200 km2 study area, one survey completed before any logging activity (preindustrial survey; 1980s), and the second survey collected {\textgreater}10 years after logging activity (modern survey; 2000s). Forest stands at the time of the preindustrial survey were primary forests. We identified stands as either burned, logged, or left aside after forest management of the area (remaining stands) between the two surveys and compared their structural and abiotic characteristics using logistic regression. The structural and abiotic characteristics of burned and logged stands differed significantly. Relative to the burned stands, logged stands were older, denser, and marked by poorer drainage and a higher proportion of black spruce; therefore post-harvest and post-burn landscapes differed in terms of their structural diversities. Traditional even-aged forest management has significantly altered the boreal forest landscape by targeting specific stands having higher economic value and leaving behind stands of lower economic value. Remaining high economic stands should be protected, and a more balanced approach to harvesting must be used in the context of ecosystem-based management.},

The objectives of this synthesis are to assemble the existing knowledge about the system, clarify the terminology in use, and discuss its place in silviculture in northeastern North America. Irregular shelterwood is compared with other regeneration methods and we propose a classification based on three variants. This silvicultural system is compatible with ecosystem-based management in forest types driven by partial stand mortality and gap dynamics and provides opportunities for maintaining old-growth forest attributes.

By comparing attributes associated with natural fire regimes and current forest management, we were able to identify four major differences for the black spruce forest of the Clay Belt. The maintenance of older forests, the spatial extent of cutover areas, the maintenance of residuals within cutovers and disturbance severity on soils are major issues that should be addressed.

	abstract = {Spatial replication is a common theme in count surveys of animals. Such surveys often generate sparse count data from which it is difficult to estimate population size while formally accounting for detection probability. In this article, I describe a class of models (N-mixture models) which allow for estimation of population size from such data. The key idea is to view site-specific population sizes, N, as independent random variables distributed according to some mixing distribution (e.g., Poisson). Prior parameters are estimated from the marginal likelihood of the data, having integrated over the prior distribution for N. Carroll and Lombard (1985, Journal of American Statistical Association 80, 423-426) proposed a class of estimators based on mixing over a prior distribution for detection probability. Their estimator can be applied in limited settings, but is sensitive to prior parameter values that are fixed a priori. Spatial replication provides additional information regarding the parameters of the prior distribution on N that is exploited by the N-mixture models and which leads to reasonable estimates of abundance from sparse data. A simulation study demonstrates superior operating characteristics (bias, confidence interval coverage) of the N-mixture estimator compared to the Caroll and Lombard estimator. Both estimators are applied to point count data on six species of birds illustrating the sensitivity to choice of prior on p and substantially different estimates of abundance as a consequence.},

Recent work has focused mainly on the impact of species diversity within single trophic levels, both experimentally and theoretically. Experiments have usually showed increased plant biomass and productivity with increasing plant diversity. Changes in biodiversity, however, may affect ecosystem processes through trophic interactions among species as well. An important current challenge is to understand how these trophic interactions affect the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Here we present a mechanistic model of an ecosystem with multiple trophic levels in which plants compete for a limiting soil nutrient. In contrast to previous studies that focused on single trophic levels, we show that plant biomass does not always increase with plant diversity and that changes in biodiversity can lead to complex if predictable changes in ecosystem processes. Our analysis demonstrates that food-web structure can profoundly influence ecosystem properties.},

Both NCO and leaf litter surveys performed well in their ability to detect P. cinereus (pˆ = 0.59 ± 0.07 [± 1 SE]; 0.49 ± 0.08, respectively) and produced similar site occupancy estimates (ψ ˆ = 0.75 ± 0.09; 0.77 ± 0.11, respectively); however, leaf litter searches took three times longer to complete. Our simulation study revealed the time required to complete leaf litter surveys limited the number of sampling sites, which reduced statistical power for detecting a 25\% change in salamander occupancy between two groups of sites. Natural cover object searches provided greater power for detecting a similar change in occupancy, largely because of high sampling size. Although reliable salamander detection data can be collected quickly using NCO surveys, we discuss situations where this technique may not be appropriate.

We found a positive association of beaver activity and a negative influence of American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) on bird assemblages. We used a multispecies hierarchical model to investigate whether bird communities differ between two major wetland habitats in boreal Canada: beaver ponds and peatland ponds. In addition to including variables such as forest cover and latitude, we adopted a structural equation model approach to estimate the occupancy of American red squirrels and its potential influence on bird communities. Using automated recording stations deployed at 50 ponds, we detected 96 bird species in 2018 and 2019. Bird species were grouped into four taxonomic guilds according to their habitat successional requirements: early successional species, late successional species, generalists, and wetland species. Beaver ponds harbored higher species richness, a pattern driven primarily by early successional species. The occupancy of almost a quarter of the species was lower in the presence of red squirrels. Late successional species responded positively to the cover of forest surrounding the pond. Our results highlight the value of considering acoustic data of red squirrels to quantify habitat quality in boreal forests. We conclude that beaver activity shapes bird assemblages through modification of their habitat, and that some bird guilds are associated negatively with the presence of American red squirrels.•Studies of bird assemblages and their responses to local and landscape factors in boreal landscapes can inform wetland conservation.•The aim of our study was to assess how bird occupancy differed between two major pond types and responded to habitat, landscape factors, and potential predators in boreal assemblages in northeastern Canada.•We detected 96 species using automated recorders deployed at 50 ponds in 2018 and 2019.•Species richness was higher in beaver ponds than peatland ponds.

At a long-term experimental trial in northern temperate hemlock-cedar forests of British Columbia, Canada, we analysed the impact of varying amounts of overstory basal area retention: 0\% (clearcut), 40\%, 70\%, and 100\% (unharvested) on CWD volume, decay class, and inputs from windthrow over 27 years. We used CWD attributes (diameter, length, decay class, and height above the ground) known to be favourable for martens to create an index for assessing the impact of harvesting intensity on CWD habitat features. Stands with 70\% retention had CWD attributes that resulted in CWD habitat features similar to unharvested stands. Clearcuts contained pieces that were smaller, more decayed, and closer to the ground, which contributed to a habitat that was less valuable, compared with stands that had higher retention. Over the 27-year period, windthrown trees were the majority of CWD inputs, and volume change was positively related to percent retention. Our results highlight that forest management influences CWD size and input dynamics over multiple decades, and the need for consideration of these impacts when undertaking long-term multiple-use forestry planning.},

We compared stands recently treated by CPRS or PCT with established stands dominated by deciduous or coniferous trees in two large blocks of mixed forests. We measured habitat components and abundance of small mammals in the four stand types. Trees (DBH ≥ 9 cm) became very rare in CPRS stands and remained at low density in PCT stands, which stimulated the growth of herbs and seedlings, resulting in increased lateral cover. Tree harvest also generated coarse woody debris in CPRS stands, which did not persist in PCT stands. Small mammals responded to these disturbances in a species-specific manner but, overall, relative abundance and species richness of small mammals were lower in PCT stands than in CPRS and closed stands. Our results suggest that forest managers should exclude some stands from PCT following CPRS or natural perturbations, to maintain ecosystem diversity at the landscape level.},
